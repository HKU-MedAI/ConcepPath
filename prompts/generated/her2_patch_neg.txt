40. Mast cell infiltration - low-density mast cells within tumor stroma; scattered distribution

Please note that the presence of these factors in whole slide images may vary, as the histological appearance of breast cancer can be highly heterogeneous. Evaluating these features should always be done by a pathologist or experienced professional, and clinical correlation should be considered.

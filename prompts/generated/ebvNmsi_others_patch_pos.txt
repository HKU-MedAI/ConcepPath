13. Peritumoral mononuclear cells - peripheral mononuclear cells; immune cells surrounding the tumor; intervining with tumor cells
14. Tumor-stromal ratio - proportion of tumor cells to stromal cells; high ratio indicates more tumor cells; low ratio indicates more stromal cells
15. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) - fibroblasts with elongated, spindle-like morphology; supportive stroma; adjacent to tumor cells
16. Necrosis - areas of cell death; loss of architecture; karyolysis and karyorrhexis; pale eosinophilic staining
17. Nuclear pleomorphism - irregular nuclear shapes and sizes; hyperchromatic nuclei; multinucleation; chromatin clumping
18. Cell discohesion - loss of cell-cell adhesion; tumor cells appear isolated or in small clusters; absence of glandular structures
19. Mitotic activity - numerous mitotic figures; atypical mitotic figures; increased proliferation index
20. Apoptotic bodies - small rounded structures; condensed nuclear material; fragments of dead cells; usually surrounded by healthy cells21. Pagetoid spread - intraepithelial extension of tumor cells; single cells or groups of cells; within the normal surface epithelium; disrupted epithelium
22. Single-cell infiltration pattern - isolated tumor cells; individual infiltration without forming cohesive clusters; diffusely scattered in the stroma
23. Psammoma bodies - round, concentric, calcified structures; laminated appearance; pink-staining on H&E slides; occasionally found in stroma
24. Tumor border configuration - assessment of tumor outline; infiltrative or pushing borders; interface between tumor cells and stroma
25. Pseudoangiomatous features - irregular, dilated spaces; lined by tumor cells; resembling vessel-like structures; absence of endothelial cells
26. Desmoplasia - dense fibrous tissue; stromal reaction surrounding cancer cells; spindle-shaped fibroblasts; collagen deposition
27. Inflammatory cell infiltration - immune cell presence; neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages; dispersed or aggregated within the tumor
28. Immune cell trapping - aggregates of immune cells; captured within the tumor stroma; not directly interacting with tumor cells
29. Interstitial edema - increased fluid content in tissue; widening of interfibrillar spaces; separation of stromal structures
30. Perineural invasion - tumor infiltration around nerves; cancer cells surrounding and invading nerve sheath; architectural disruption31. Squamous differentiation - tumor cells with a squamous appearance; keratin pearls; intercellular bridges in the tumor tissue
32. Mucin extravasation - extravasated mucin within the stroma; result of ruptured glands or acini; surrounded by inflammatory cells
33. Oncocytic features - tumor cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm; large cells with abundant mitochondria and round, centrally placed nuclei
34. Microcalcifications - small, localized calcifications; seen scattered within the tumor stroma; often associated with neoplastic cells
35. Tumor-associated macrophages - macrophages in the stroma; associated with cancer cells; a heterogeneous population with different phenotypes
36. Satellite foci - small clusters of tumor cells; separated from the main tumor bulk; possibly caused by tumor cell shedding or lymphovascular spread
37. Tumor-associated adipocytes - fat cells within or surrounding the tumor; morphologically altered adipocytes; potentially influencing tumor microenvironment
38. Dystrophic calcification - abnormal calcium deposit; associated with necrosis and cellular destruction; seen as dark blue or black structures in H&E slides
39. Adherent tumor cells - tumor cells tightly attached to ECM proteins; ability to produce their own ECM proteins; responsible for invasion and metastasis
40. Cytokeratin-positive cells - cells that express cytokeratins; common in epithelial cells; can be used for identification of tumor origin

Note that the presence of these features alone does not necessarily confirm the Microsatellite Instability subtype of gastric cancer. Additional molecular analyses, such as immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for microsatellite instability, are required for definitive diagnosis.

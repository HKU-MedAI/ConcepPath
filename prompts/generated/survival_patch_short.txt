1. Tumor size - smaller dimensions; well-circumscribed borders
2. Tumor shape - regular morphology; smooth edges
3. Tumor location - peripheral lung regions; minimal involvement of vital structures
4. Tumor growth pattern - clear differentiation; limited dedifferentiation; non-invasive growth; slow expansion
5. Histological subtypes - adenocarcinomas; bronchoalveolar carcinomas; less aggressive subtypes
6. Lymphovascular invasion - absence; limited lymphatic spread; minimal vascular invasions
7. Necrosis - limited areas; absence of coagulative necrosis; less disrupted tissue architecture
8. Inflammatory infiltration - fewer leukocytes; fewer macrophages; few signs of immune response
9. Stroma content - less extensive; limited fibrotic component; less-structured cellular networks
10. Tumor budding - minimal; limited tumor nests; fewer invasive cells at the invasion front11. Pleural invasion - absence; no tumor extension onto pleura or chest wall
12. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) - high levels; extensive presence; indication of strong immune response
13. Mitotic count - low rate; minimal cell division; slower tumor proliferation
14. Nuclear pleomorphism - limited variability; minor differences in cell nuclei size and shape; less aggressive behavior
15. Presence of mucin - low amounts; less aggressive mucin-secreting adenocarcinomas 
16. Tumor encapsulation - complete encapsulation; limited infiltrative growth; barriers against surrounding tissue invasion
17. Angiogenesis - low vascularity; limited blood vessel formation; slower growth and limited nutrient supply
18. Tumor-stroma ratio - low; higher proportion of tumor cells; limited interaction with stromal components
19. Cell density - low number of cancer cells; less aggressive tumor behavior
20. Cellular organization - well-organized tissue arrangement; limited disturbances in tissue structure

Remember that this information should be considered in the context of the individual patient. The role of features in predicting survival can vary by cancer type, stage, and other factors. Additionally, whole slide images alone cannot always provide enough information to fully assess these factors. Clinicopathological data, molecular tests, and other factors must be considered to form a comprehensive assessment of prognosis.21. Chromatin pattern - homogeneous distribution; low nuclear irregularities; less aggressive behavior
22. Tumor margin - well-defined edges; clear demarcation from surrounding healthy tissue; less invasiveness
23. Eosinophilic infiltrates - high presence of eosinophils; possible indication of a stronger immune response; better prognosis
24. Desmoplasia - low levels; limited fibroblast activation; less fibrotic tissue and fibrosis
25. Individual cell shape - uniformity in cancer cell shapes; limited cellular atypia; less aggressive tumor behavior
26. Tumor-associated fibroblasts - low amounts; limited interaction with cancer cells 
27. Tissue clarity - well-preserved structural features; low artifact interference; easier assessment of tumor features
28. Immune contexture - high presence of effector T-cells; involvement of dendritic cells; more effective immune response
29. Cancer-associated fibroblasts - low levels; less tumor-promoting surrounding environment
30. Cytokeratin expression - limited phenotypic changes; lower changes indicating a lower aggressive subtype.


Please note that these factors should be considered along with clinical findings, test results, and other contributing factors to form a comprehensive understanding of tumor behavior and prognosis. The results will vary depending on the cancer type and stage, as well as the individual patient.

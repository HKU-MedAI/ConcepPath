The early symptoms of lung adenocarcinoma patients are inapparent, and the clinical diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma is primarily through X-ray examination and pathological section examination, whereas the discovery of biomarkers points out another direction for the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma with the development of bioinformatics technology. However, it is not accurate and trustworthy to diagnose lung adenocarcinoma due to omics data with high-dimension and low-sample size (HDLSS) features or biomarkers produced by utilizing only single omics data. To address the above problems, the feature selection methods of biological analysis are used to reduce the dimension of gene expression data (GSE19188) and DNA methylation data (GSE139032, GSE49996). In addition, the Cartesian product method is used to expand the sample set and integrate gene expression data and DNA methylation data. The classification is built by using a deep neural network and is evaluated on K-fold cross validation. Moreover, gene ontology analysis and literature retrieving are used to analyze the biological relevance of selected genes, TCGA database is used for survival analysis of these potential genes through Kaplan-Meier estimates to discover the detailed molecular mechanism of lung adenocarcinoma. Survival analysis shows that COL5A2 and SERPINB5 are significant for identifying lung adenocarcinoma and are considered biomarkers of lung adenocarcinoma.

Feature Selection Method
The gene expression data and DNA methylation data are the basis for constructing the prediction model of LUAD. These data sets have HDLSS characteristics. If the datasets with HDLSS characteristics are directly used to build the prediction model, there will be severe overfitting and high variance of gradient, which is the main challenge of machine learning. In order to solve this problem, we use the biometric selection method to reduce features and reduce the risk of overfitting. Identifying differentially expressed gene (DEG) is a typical method to process gene expression data, and the selected genes have clear biological interpretation (Porcu et al., 2020). Selecting only disease-related characteristic genes from all features can not only avoid the disaster of dimensionality but also effectively improve the classification effect. More importantly, differentially expressed genes can be used to study the mechanism of disease or as clinical biomarkers for early diagnosis. In DNA methylation data, DNA methylation can control the expression of genes near CpG sites, we mainly reduce the characteristics and retain the biological significance of the data set by identifying differential methylation position (DMP). FC (fold change) and t-test are used to calculate the differences in transcription levels between healthy and diseased individuals, so as to identify DEG or DMP which may be disease- related factors.
The principle of the FC algorithm is to calculate the multiple of the average expression level of genes in two types of samples. If the value reaches the preset threshold, it will be determined that the genes are differentially genes. The principle of t-test is to calculate a t-statistic for each gene to measure the difference in gene expression between the two types of samples, and then calculate the significance p-value according to the t-distribution to measure the significance of the difference. In addition, to prevent some genes from being misjudged as differential genes, we also calculate the false discovery rate (FDR) through the significance analysis of the microarrays algorithm to control the error rate of multiple tests and reduce the false-positive rate of results.
So far, many researchers have applied the method of identifying DEG and DMP to process gene expression data and DNA methylation data and identify cancer biomarkers more accurately (Li et al., 2019; Motalebzadeh and Eskandari, 2021). Faced with the complex gene relationship, Yang et al. argued that MI can effectively filter out pathogenic genes and provide a new way for drug repositioning (Yang and Hao, 2019). Dolezal et al. proposed a t-SNE model for dimensionality reduction, which can reliably distinguish all normal tissues and tumor tissues based on the characteristic RPT expression pattern (Dolezal et al., 2018). MI and t-SNE methods can reduce feature discovery of pathogenic genes, but cannot reflect biological processes, so they are not suitable for dimensionality reduction of multi-omics datasets.
The identification of DEG and DMP is achieved through the “limma” package of the R software (Ritchie et al., 2015; Maksimovic et al., 2016). For gene expression data to identify DEGs, the threshold value shall satisfy |logFC|>2, p-value<0.05, and FDR<0.01. In DNA methylation data, the same way is used to identify DMPs, and the threshold should meet | logFC | > 2.5, p-value < 0.05 and FDR <0.01. Genes are differentially expressed, hypermethylation and hypomethylation in different samples occurred. This gene may have a potential relationship with LUAD. As a result, it is reasonable to believe that the overlap between DEG and DMP has a potential relationship with LUAD, so we take the intersection of DEG and DMP (Peng et al., 2017).

DISCUSSION
Table 6 shows the overlapping genes that meet DEG and DMP at the same time in each fold during five-fold cross-validati. We also select the genes that appear in each fold, to avoid the error caused by chance in crcross-validationFoninally, 12 key genes are identified and considered as potential biomarkers of LUAD. To prove whether these 12 genes are capable of recognizing LUAD, the following gene analysis has been made.
The selected gene set is analyzed by using the DAVID database. As shown in Table 7, gene ontology reported the biological significance of genes. “GO:0050900 leukocyte migration” affects the proliferation and migration of LUAD A549 cells; “GO:0046982 protein heterodimerization activity” is related to LUAD (Zhou et al., 2017) and is also a similar biological activity in liver cancer (Wang et al., 2011) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The results showed that the activity of protein dimer interacted selectively and non- covalently with different proteins to form heterodimer (Lan et al., 2014); “GO:0001228 transcriptional activator activity, RNA polymerase II transcription regulatory region sequence-specific binding” is one of the important pathways involved in LINC00648, and is related to lung cancer (Zhao et al., 2020).
After literature retrieving, the gene ABCA3, studies have shown that it is usually highly expressed in the damaged lung (Stahlman et al., 2007), and may provide important clues for the diagnosis of LUAD. THBS gene may play a double-edged sword role in the development, the anti-angiogenic and oncogenic function of LUAD. COL5A2 is one of the seven genes co- expressed by TSHB2. When COL5A2 is highly expressed, the survival rate of patients decreases (Weng et al., 2016). Compared with normal lung tissue cells, the SERPINB5 gene is specifically expressed at high levels in lung cancer cells and can be used as a diagnostic marker of lung cancer (Yoon et al., 2011). COL1A1 is considered a downstream product of cytoglobin, which is related to tumor biology and contributes to the adaptive response to oxidative stress and hypoxia/reoxygenation events, thereby promoting lung tumor invasiveness, metastasis, and resistance to treatment (Mendoza et al., 2015). Liu et al. proposed that COL1A1 is a potential biomarker for the prognosis of LUAD (Liu and Huang, 2020). Lung tumors rely on glucose, cystine, and glutamine. SLC7A11 is a cystine/glutamate transporter, which promotes tumor growth and development (Lin et al., 2020). Ji et al. also proposed that SLC7A11 overexpression is a candidate biomarker SLC7A11 for lung cancer (Ji et al., 2018). TWIST1 is involved in embryogenesis and promotes malignant transformation and LUAD progression through epithelial- mesenchymal transition (Karine et al., 2012).
The Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis of the 12 potential biomarkers identified in 492 LUAD patients using the TCGA database shows that COL5A2 and SERPINB5 are significantly correlated with the prognosis of LUAD (Figure 7).

CONCLUSION
In this study, we use the DNN model to predict LUAD and identify biomarkers based on integrated multi-omics data. By comparing different feature selection methods and different prediction models, the results show that the method of this research is better. The advantage of the method is that it used integrated multi-omics data; there is no blind dimensionality reduction in feature selection, but biologically significant features are selected. The results of biological correlation analysis and literature verification also show that the selected genes can be used as biomarkers of LUAD. Although we have done careful bioinformatics analysis, there are still some limitations. In the future, we can continue to explore the application of this method to other similar omics data, and we will continue to improve our method.

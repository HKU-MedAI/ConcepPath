Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most diagnosed subtype of lung cancer; ferroptosis is widely involved in the pathological cell death associated with various cancers, including lung cancer. However, the comprehensive relationship between ferroptosis and LUAD is little known in molecular levels until now. In the present study, 513 LUAD patients could be aggregated into three clusters by consensus clustering based on RNA sequencing data of 291 ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database; cluster2 had significant survival advantage compared to the other two clusters. A novel prognostic model of 8 differential FRGs was constructed to effectively divide LUAD patients into high- or low-risk group according to the risk scores by the Cox and LASSO regression analyses. The overall survival of LUAD patients in the high-risk group was significantly worse in the TCGA and GEO cohorts. Moreover, patients with radiation therapy or high clinical stage had obviously higher risk scores. We validated the differential mRNA and protein expression of four FRGs in paired tumor and normal samples from our clinical cohort. Our study constructed a novel FRG signature to predict the prognosis of LUAD patients, which might provide a new prognostic tool and potential therapeutic targets for LUAD.

Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in the world, with 2.1 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths predicted in 2018 (1). The histological subtypes of lung cancer consist of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC); approximately 85% of patients belong to NSCLC (2, 3). Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most diagnosed subtype of NSCLC, followed by lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) (4). LUAD is associated with distinct genomic alterations and widespread molecular heterogeneity compared with other lung cancer subtypes (4). Although substantial progress in the treatment of lung cancer have been achieved over the past decades, the 5-year survival rate of lung cancer patients remains only 4%–17% depending on stage and regional differences (5). Therefore, it is important to identify novel prognostic biomarkers and develop an effective prognostic model for predicting the survival of LUAD patients. Historically, cell death was initially considered to be
accidental and passive (6). Unlike accidental cell death, regulated cell death can be modulated through a series of cellular mechanisms and signaling pathways (7). The best- studied form of regulated cell death is apoptosis, which is mainly triggered by the activation of proteases from the caspase family (8). In recent years, there has been a growing attention in the importance of regulated cell death mechanisms beyond apoptosis in studying tumor suppression because resistance to apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer (9, 10). Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death that involves lethal, iron-catalyzed lipid damage; the term ferroptosis was described in 2012 (11). Ferroptotic death is a form of regulated cell death, as it is dramatically modulated by pharmacological perturbation of lipid repair systems involving glutathione and GPX4 (12). Since the initial description of this process, an increasing number of compounds and metabolic pathways have been identified related to ferroptosis (10, 13).
Ferroptosis has been implicated in the pathological cell death associated with various disease conditions including cancer and degenerative diseases (14, 15). Importantly, ferroptosis has potential physiological functions in tumor suppression. The p53 protein could inhibit cystine uptake and sensitize cells to ferroptosis by repressing the expression of SLC7A11, a key component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter highly expressed in human tumors (16). Similarly, tumor suppressor BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) inhibited tumor development partly through repressing SLC7A11 expression and elevating lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis (17). In LUAD, Alvarez et al. reported that suppression of NFS1 could cooperate with inhibition of cysteine transport to trigger ferroptosis in vitro and slow tumor growth (18). Zhang et al. found that endogenous glutamate was critical for ferroptosis sensitivity via ADCY10-dependent YAP suppression in LUAD, and ferroptosis-based treatment might be a good strategy for LUAD patients with later-stage and/or therapy-resistant tumors (19).
Although the expression profiles of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) have been utilized to develop some survival models for prognostic prediction of LUAD patients, the published studies just adopted few FRGs to analyze the prognosis signature (20–22). Therefore, we collected more FRGs to stratify LUAD patients based on mRNA expression levels in the present study. LUAD patients in three clusters had significantly distinct survival time by FRG expression signatures. Differential FRGs among the three clusters were significantly enriched in response to multiple stress- and ferroptosis-related pathways. Then, LUAD patients could be divided into high- or low-risk group according to the risk scores of the prognostic model by 8 FRGs in the training and validation cohorts. The patients with radiation therapy experience or high clinical stage had obviously high-risk scores. Our findings might be helpful to understand the potential clinical value of ferroptosis- related genes in LUAD and provide a new tool for risk and prognosis assessment in LUAD.

DISCUSSION
Ferroptosis has been linked to cancer since the very beginning of this study field: the initial discovery of some chemical inducers of ferroptosis was the result of hunting for novel antitumor chemicals (27, 28). Subsequent mechanistic studies have revealed that numerous cancer-relevant genes and signaling pathways regulated ferroptosis in several types of carcinoma, including lung cancer. The FSP1–CoQ10–NAD(P)H pathway existed as an independent parallel system, which cooperated with GPX4 and glutathione to suppress
ferroptosis in a number of cancer cells (29, 30). Cystine starvation of NSCLC cell lines induced accumulation of g-glutamyl peptides, which were produced due to a non-canonical activity of glutamate- cysteine ligase catalytic subunit, and eventually limited the accumulation of glutamate, thereby protecting against ferroptosis (31). Except for some coding mRNAs, long non-coding RNA LINC00336 could also serve as an endogenous sponge of microRNA 6852 to regulate the expression of cystathionine-b- synthase, a surrogate marker of ferroptosis, and promote cell growth by inhibiting ferroptosis in lung cancer (32).
In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the clustering effects of ferroptosis genes in LUAD patients based on the expression levels of 291 FRGs. Three clusters of LUAD patients revealed a prominent prognostic difference, and a risk model of 8 FRGs was developed on the basis of differential FRGs among the three clusters. Although similar risk models of FRGs have been established in LUAD (33, 34), our analytic strategy provided a new method for discovering new prognostic-related genes in cancer by differential analysis in three clusters. The results revealed that 8 FRGs of risk models were correlated with overall survival of LUAD patients; among them, PEBP1 and ACSL3 were confirmed as prognostic factors in LUAD (21, 33, 34). However, our prognostic model identified that 6 new FRGs were significantly correlated with the survival of LUAD patients, including EGLN1, MIF, CFTR, PANX1, RRM2, and HERPUD1.
The egl-9 family hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (EGLN1) catalyzes the posttranslational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in hypoxia- inducible factor (HIF) alpha proteins (35). Recent study also showed that elevated EGLN1 expression might be a valuable biomarker of poor prognosis in patients with LUAD, but not in LUSC (36). Moreover, Reggiani et al. identified and validated that the EGLN1 gene might be a novel therapeutic target, preferentially associated with KRAS-mutated LUAD by integrating functional genomic analysis, in vitro data of cancer cell lines, gene druggability data, and patients’ transcriptomic and mutational data (37). Mechanistically, EGLN1 pro-oncogenic activity was partially dependent on HIF1A. The macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine or growth factor that contributes to inflammatory, autoimmune, and malignant disease pathologies (38). We found that MIF was significantly upregulated in LUAD tumor tissue compared to normal samples, and a high expression of MIF was correlated with poor prognosis of LUAD patients. Kamimura also discovered that both MIF mRNA and protein were higher in LUAD specimens than in the normal alveolar epithelium (39). Winner et al. reported that a novel inhibitor that served as a suicide substrate for MIF could effectively inhibit motility and growth of lung cancer cells (38). MiR-608 could suppress LUAD invasion and migration by directly targeting MIF (40). These results suggested that MIF could be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for LUAD. DNA methylation might be crucial for the downregulation of CFTR gene expression in lung cancer, and promoter hypermethylation of CFTR could also be an important prognostic factor in NSCLC (41). Multiple studies have shown that a high expression of RRM2 could act as an independent predictive factor of poor prognosis in LUAD patients (42, 43). Moreover, knockdown of RRM2 suppressed LUAD cell proliferation and migration in vitro and prolonged survival time in metastatic models (44). However, PANX1 and HERPUD1 lack related reports in LUAD except our findings in this study.
Inevitably, there are several limitations in our study. First, based on the retrospective data from the TCGA database, we constructed a prognostic model by differential FRGs to predict the survival of LUAD patients. A validation of the risk model was performed using retrospective data from the GSE31210 and GSE30219 cohorts. Thus, we need more data to verify the clinical application value of our FRG-based survival model. Second, although we analyzed the relative expression levels of 8 FRGs from this prognostic model in paired tumor and normal samples based on TCGA data; further experiments are required to validate the expression levels and risk score in clinical samples.
In conclusion, we collected FRGs and mRNA expression profiles to construct a novel risk model of 8 FRGs for predicting the overall survival of LUAD patients. This model was shown to be associated with LUAD patients’ survival and clinical stage. Our study might provide insights for further research on ferroptosis as a prognostic biomarker and potential functional target in LUAD.

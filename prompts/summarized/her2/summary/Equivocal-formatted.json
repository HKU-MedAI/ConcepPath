    "HER2 Low Expression": "Faint staining; barely perceptible; >10% tumor cells",
    "HER2 Ultra-Low Expression": "Weak to moderate staining; complete membrane; >10% tumor cells; Strong staining; complete membrane; <10% tumor cells",
    "IHC Score 2+": "No staining; faint staining; <10% tumor cells",
    "Heterogeneity": "Variable HER2 expression; within the same tumor; challenging determination",

    "Estrogen Receptor": "Nuclear localization; intensity varies; >1% tumor cells for positivity",
    "MutL Proteins": "Absent/reduced staining; MutL proteins (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6); non-tumor cells show normal staining; serves as internal control",

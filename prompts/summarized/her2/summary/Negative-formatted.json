{
    "HER2 Protein Regular": "No membrane staining or <10% staining; partial membrane staining in >10% of cells.",
    "DDR (DNA damage response) Effective": "Lack/reduced expression; indicative of defective DNA repair; susceptibility to DDR inhibitors.",
    "PARP Overexpression": "Strong nuclear staining; localizes to nucleus; indicates overexpression.",
    "Lack BRCA Proteins": "No nuclear staining; indicates non-functional/absent BRCA protein.",
    "Lack RAD51 Proteins": "Absent/reduced nuclear foci formation post-DNA damage; indicates HRR pathway deficiency.",
    "AKT Phosphorylation": "Located in cytoplasm/nucleus; p-AKT staining varies by phosphorylation site (Ser473, Thr308).",
    "Lack PTEN Protein": "Complete absence of staining; indicates undetectable PTEN protein due to mutations.",
    "PIK3CA Proteins Overexpression": "Positive IHC staining; cytoplasmic or membranous localization.",

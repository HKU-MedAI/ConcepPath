HER2 Overexpression:
Strong, complete membrane staining indicative of HER2 overexpression.

MAPK Phosphorylation:
Typically, p-MAPK would be expected to be seen in the cytoplasm and possibly in the cell nucleus because the MAPK pathway can activate transcription factors in the nucleus. The staining pattern can vary from diffuse to granular, depending on the level of phosphorylation and the distribution of the active kinase within the tumor cells. Histologically, areas with active signaling pathways might correspond with regions of increased cellular proliferation or tumor aggressiveness, which could manifest as areas with higher cellularity or more pleomorphic (variable in size and shape) tumor cells.

PI3K/AKT Phosphorylation: 
The staining for p-AKT is typically cytoplasmic because AKT is primarily active in the cytoplasm, though it can also translocate to the nucleus. The distribution can be focal or diffuse within the tumor tissue, depending on how uniformly the pathway is activated across the tumor. 

Caspase Staining: 
Caspases are a family of enzymes that play a key role in the execution of apoptosis. If apoptosis is inhibited, there might be reduced staining for activated caspases in IHC.

Cyclins Overexpression: 
Cyclins, such as cyclin D1, E, A, and B, may show nuclear staining because they function within the nucleus to activate CDKs, facilitating the progression of the cell cycle. The staining pattern could range from weak to strong depending on the level of overexpression.

Cyclin-Dependent Kinases Overexpression: 
CDKs, which are activated by cyclins, are also localized in the nucleus and should show nuclear staining. Overexpression or increased activity would result in stronger nuclear staining.

Ki-67 Overexpression: 
Although not a regulator, Ki-67 is a commonly used marker for cell proliferation. Ki-67 stains nuclei of cells that are in the active phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and M phase), but not resting cells (G0 phase). In aggressive tumors, a high percentage of Ki-67 staining reflects high cell proliferation.

Bcl-2 Proteins Overexpression: 
Typically shows up as cytoplasmic staining because it is localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane, although it may sometimes also be seen in the nucleus. In HER2-positive breast cancer, Bcl-2 staining would likely be moderate to strong in intensity if the protein is overexpressed.

Survivin Overexpression: 
It is part of the IAP family and is often found in the cytoplasm and occasionally in the nucleus of cancer cells. It is involved in controlling cell division and inhibiting apoptosis. In IHC staining, survivin would appear as nuclear or cytoplasmic staining, depending on its function in the cell at the time of staining.

XIAP and cIAP Overexpression:
These IAPs would typically show cytoplasmic staining in IHC images, reflecting their role in inhibiting caspases in the cytoplasm. Overexpression would be indicated by stronger and more diffuse staining patterns.

p53 Mutations: 
cells with mutant p53 may show strong and diffuse nuclear staining because the mutated protein is more stable and accumulates in the nucleus. The intensity and extent of staining can vary depending on the level of p53 accumulation.

GATA3 Overexpression:
The presence of GATA3 would typically result in nuclear staining because it functions within the nucleus as a transcription factor. Positive GATA3 staining would indicate the presence of luminal differentiation and could be associated with a more favorable prognosis, especially in HER2-positive/ER-positive breast cancer. Overexpression of GATA3 would present as strong and widespread nuclear staining in the tumor cells. This pattern is often seen in well-differentiated tumors.

GCDFP-15 Positive:
Positive staining for GCDFP-15 would appear as cytoplasmic granular staining within the breast cancer cells because the protein is secreted into the lumen of breast ducts and is associated with apocrine differentiation.

Cytokeratins Overexpression: 
Breast carcinomas typically express cytokeratins, which are intermediate filament proteins found in the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells. Cytokeratins 7 and 20 can be particularly useful in differentiating breast carcinoma from other types of tumors in metastatic sites.

Ki-67 Overexpression: 
This marker indicates proliferation and can show variable nuclear staining in metastatic lesions. A high Ki-67 index suggests a highly proliferative tumor, which is often the case in metastatic disease.

Loss E-Cadherin: 
In lobular carcinoma, which can also be HER2-positive, loss of E-cadherin can be seen with negative staining patterns and can help distinguish it from ductal carcinoma.

High Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocytes Levels:
TILs are usually not stained directly in routine IHC; instead, their presence is inferred from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections. Lymphocytes will appear as small, round, darkly stained nuclei without much visible cytoplasm.

Hormone Receptor Staining: 
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) can also be assessed for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) status, which would show nuclear staining if positive.

Dense Clustering: 
A dense aggregation of cancer cells with little intervening stroma. On H&E stained slides, this would appear as large areas densely packed with cells, having high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, and scant stromal tissue.

Uniform Staining: 
In IHC images, areas of high cellularity may show more uniform staining for markers that are expressed by tumor cells. For HER2, this would mean extensive, uniform membrane staining in the case of HER2 overexpression.

Nuclear Markers: 
High cellularity areas would show a high density of nuclei stained for nuclear markers, such as ER, PR, Ki-67 (a proliferation marker), or p53. Ki-67, in particular, could show high percentage staining in high cellularity areas, indicating a high proliferation index.

Membrane Markers: 
HER2 staining would display strong circumferential membrane staining in areas of high cellularity if the tumor is HER2-positive.

Stromal Markers: 
In contrast, stromal markers would be less evident in areas of high tumor cellularity due to the reduced amount of stromal tissue.

Estrogen Receptor Staining: 
ER positivity is indicated by the presence of nuclear staining in the tumor cells. The staining pattern should be uniform and can range from weak to strong. The percentage of positively staining nuclei is assessed, with more than 1% of tumor nuclei staining positive generally considered ER-positive.

Progesterone Receptor Staining: 
Similar to ER, PgR positivity is seen as nuclear staining within the tumor cells. The intensity and percentage of PgR-positive nuclei are also evaluated, with the same threshold of more than 1% positivity for a tumor to be considered PgR-positive.

Well-defined Tumor Morphology: 
HR-positive tumors often have more distinct cell borders and are less pleomorphic than HR-negative tumors.

Lower Grade Features: 
HR-positive tumors tend to have lower nuclear grade and less mitotic activity compared to HR-negative tumors.

Tubule Formation: 
The presence of well-formed tubular structures is more common in HR-positive tumors.

Stromal Separation: 
The presence of edema in the stroma surrounding a tumor can be seen as clear, pale-staining areas that represent fluid accumulation. These areas may separate collagen fibers and other components of the stroma.

Inflammatory Cell Infiltration: 
Edema may be accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration, which would show as clusters of small, darkly staining nuclei that represent lymphocytes and other immune cells.

Tumor Architecture Distortion: 
Peritumoral edema may distort the normal architecture of the breast tissue and can push the tumor cells into clusters or cords.

High Tumor Cellularity: 
On H&E-stained whole slide images, areas of high cellularity will show densely packed cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios and scant intercellular stroma. This can give the tissue a "blue" appearance due to the dense staining of the nuclei.

Mitotic Figures: 
These may be more numerous in aggressive tumors, indicating a high proliferation rate. They can be identified as cells in the process of division.

Necrosis: 
This can occur when the growth of the tumor outpaces its blood supply, leading to areas of dead cells, which might be visualized as regions of cell debris and loss of normal tissue architecture.

High Mitotic Index: 
A large number of cells undergoing mitosis, which indicates active cell division.

Pleomorphism: 
Variation in size and shape of cancer cells and their nuclei.

Edema: 
Accumulation of fluid in the interstitial tissues surrounding the tumor, which can appear as clear spaces or separation of the stromal collagen fibers.

Hemorrhage: 
Extravasation of red blood cells into the tumor or surrounding tissue.

High Vascular Density: 
An increased number of blood vessels within the tumor or at its invasive front.

CD31 and CD34 Overexpression: 
These are endothelial cell markers used to highlight blood vessels in tissue sections. An increased number of positively stained structures would indicate a higher vascular density.

VEGF Overexpression: 
Staining for VEGF can show the presence and distribution of this key factor in angiogenesis and vascular permeability. VEGF would be seen within the cytoplasm of tumor cells that are producing it.

D2-40 (Podoplanin) Overexpression: 
A marker for lymphatic endothelium, which can help identify increased lymphangiogenesis and potentially increased lymphatic permeability.

Microvessel Density: 
Increased microvessel density can be visualized on H&E stained sections as an increased number of small, irregular blood vessel lumens within the tumor stroma. These vessels can appear more disorganized than the normal vasculature.

Hemorrhage: 
As a side effect of neoangiogenesis, the newly formed blood vessels are often leaky, which can lead to areas of hemorrhage within the tumor.

Lack of Apoptotic Bodies: 
Fewer than expected apoptotic bodies (which appear as small, dense, eosinophilic fragments of cells) for the rate of tumor growth, suggesting that apoptosis is not occurring at a normal rate.

With a better understanding of the etiology of breast cancer, molecularly targeted drugs have been developed and are being testing for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. Targeted drugs that inhibit the estrogen receptor (ER) or estrogen-activated path- ways include the selective ER modulators (tamoxifen, raloxifene, and lasofoxifene) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) (anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) have been tested in preclinical and clinical studies. Tamoxifen and raloxifene have been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer and promising results of AIs in breast cancer trials, suggest that AIs might be even more effective in the prevention of ER-positive breast cancer. However, these agents only prevent ER-positive breast cancer.Therefore, current research is focused on identifying preventive therapies for other forms of breast cancer such as human epi- dermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC, breast cancer that does express ER, progesterone receptor, or HER2). HER2-positive breast cancers are currently treated with anti-HER2 therapies including trastuzumab and lapatinib, and preclinical and clinical studies are now being conducted to test these drugs for the pre- vention of HER2-positive breast cancers. Several promising agents currently being tested in cancer prevention trials for the prevention of TNBC include poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, vitamin D, and rexinoids, both of which activate nuclear hormone receptors (the vitamin D and retinoid X receptors). This review discusses currently used breast cancer preventive drugs, and describes the progress of research striving to identify and develop more effective preventive agents for all forms of breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, with an estimated 232,340 new cases, in 2013 in the U.S. alone (1). This represents close to 30% of all estimated new cancer cases in women, and after a decline in the incidence rate, largely due to the reduction in the use of hormone replacement therapy (2, 3), the incidence rate has been stable for the past decade (1). Although there has been a steady decrease in breast cancer mortality since the early 90s (1), due largely to improvements in the early detec- tion and treatment of breast tumors (4), in the U.S. approximately 40,000 women will die of breast cancer this year (1). Despite these positive reductions in mortality, preventing breast cancer prior to its development remains the most effective way to reduce mortality resulting from this disease. Recent clinical trials have now demon- strated that effective prevention is possible for some forms of breast cancer, and rapid advances being made during this genomic era are providing further understanding of breast cancer subtypes, laying the foundation for the development of preventive therapies for all forms of breast cancer.
Genomic profiling of breast cancer using expression arrays has proven useful for the elucidating different molecular forms of breast cancer. The analysis of gene expression patterns by Perou et al. (5), led to the discovery and identification of four distinct mole- cular subtypes of breast cancer with RNA expression profiles divid- ing the tumors into at least four subgroups (5). These subgroups are characterized by variations in overexpression, with the luminal
subgroup highly expressing genes normally associated with breast luminal cells, the second subgroup expressing genes typically active in breast basal epithelial cells (basal-like subgroup), and the third subgroup overexpressing human epidermal growth factor recep- tor 2 (HER2 subgroup), which is associated with a unique set of genes. The fourth tumor subgroup consists of tumors that cluster with normal breast samples, and are classified as normal-like breast tumors. Follow-up analysis of a tumor set approximately twice the size as the original, demonstrated distinct differences in survival and treatment response between different molecular subtypes (6) (see Table 1). Luminal A tumors were associated with the longest overall survival, while HER2 and basal-like tumors were associ- ated with decreased survival. Similar results were observed with time to recurrence (6). It is important to note that these tumors were obtained prior to the widespread use of anti-HER2 therapies, thus explaining the poor survival of the HER2 group. These find- ings have since been confirmed in a population-based study (7). However, the drivers for decreased overall and disease-free survival in women with basal-like tumors remain unclear. In 2007, Perou et al. extended their initial findings by identifying yet another molecular subtype, the claudin-low tumors, which underexpress genes involved in tight-junctions and cell–cell adhesion, includ- ing several Claudin genes and E-cadherin and high expression of endothelial markers (8). From a clinical perspective, these claudin- low tumors are associated with a poor prognosis (9). The basal and claudin-low molecular subtypes significantly overlap the clinical riple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), which have low levels of ER, PR, and HER2 proteins. TNBCs exhibit a high level of mol- ecular heterogeneity, are highly aggressive, and have proven chal- lenging for the development of targeted therapeutic treatments, and for the development of effective preventive strategies.
To further define the TNBC subtypes, Lehmann et al. ana- lyzed the gene expression profiles of 21 breast cancer data sets, which included almost 600 TNBCs and identified six distinct subtypes: (1) immunomodulatory, (2) mesenchymal, (3) mes- enchymal stem-like, (4) luminal androgen receptor, (5) basal-like 1, and (6) basal-like 2 (10). Stratification of breast cancer cell lines according to the same gene expression profiles, demon- strated that these six TNBC subtypes are uniquely sensitive to different drugs. Furthermore survival varies across each of these subtypes, with mesenchymal stem-like and luminal androgen receptor associated with the longest and shortest relapse-free sur- vival, respectively (see Table 1). Overexpression of immune cell processing genes (e.g., cytokine signaling and antigen processing pathway genes) characterizes the immunomodulatory subtype, forming a rationale for developing preventive agents targeting the immune system, cytokines, and immune signal transduction pathways. The mesenchymal and mesenchymal stem-like sub- types exhibit enrichment for pathways involved with cell motility and cell differentiation, providing the foundation for studies of drugs targeting pathways regulating cell migration. The lumi- nal androgen receptor subtype is ER-negative. However, estro- gen and androgen hormone signaling pathways are activated in these tumors, supporting the use of anti-androgens and pos- sibly anti-estrogens, for the treatment and prevention of these tumors. Upregulation of the cell cycle and cell division path- ways defines basal-like subtype 1, suggesting the potential efficacy
of anti-mitotic and DNA-damaging drugs, as well as poly(ADP- ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors to treat and possibly prevent tumors of this type. The final subtype, basal-like subtype 2 is associated with enhancement of the growth factor signaling path- ways, suggesting strategies targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), met proto-oncogene (MET), nerve growth factor (NGF), and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways, along with genes involved in gluco- neogenesis and glycolysis, may be useful for the treatment and prevention of this group of tumors. The major challenge will be to determine the minimal number of drugs to combine to prevent all of these forms of cancer, and to select drugs that will be both effective and safe.

HER2 INHIBITORS
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 is a member of the EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Upon phosphoryla- tion of MAPK, EGFR signaling regulates the transportation of mitogenic signals across the cell membrane via a signaling cas- cade. Once intracellular, these signals induce proliferation and inhibit cell death; thus, misregulation of this pathway results in uncontrolled growth and inhibition of apoptosis. Overexpression of growth factor receptors has been identified in many different cancers, with HER2 overexpression present in 20–25% of breast cancers (43, 44). By targeting HER2 through different molecular mechanisms, EGFR inhibitors, and particularly HER2 inhibitors (including trastuzumab and the dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor lapa- tinib), inhibit tumor growth, and induce apoptosis. The human- ized HER2 antibody trastuzumab, targets the extracellular domain of HER2, while lapatinib inhibits the kinase activity of HER2 and EGFR (Figure 1). Both trastuzumab (44) and lapatinib (43) have been shown to be effective in the adjuvant setting for women with HER2-positive breast cancer. Research is now focused on determining whether HER2-positive breast cancers can be pre- vented by treating patients earlier at the stage of non-invasive breast cancer. Our group has shown that HER2-transgenic mice treated with the HER2/EGFR dual kinase inhibitor lapatinib (45) or the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib (46) have delayed development of HER2-positive mammary tumors. These studies demonstrated that treatment with the lapatinib also inhibits the development of mammary gland pre-malignant lesions in these mice (45).
Due to these positive adjuvant clinical trial and preclinical study results demonstrating delay of HER2-positive tumors following treatment with HER2 inhibitors, clinical cancer prevention trials have been developed to test trastuzumab or lapatinib in women with HER2-positive DCIS lesions. A Phase II trial testing a single pre-operative dose of trastuzumab in women with HER2-positive DCIS demonstrated an immunologic response that was not asso- ciated with either a pathologic or proliferation-related response (see Table 2) (25). The ongoing NSABP B-43 trial is testing the effects of radiation alone or in combination with two doses of trastuzumab (after surgical excision of the DCIS) on ipsilateral incidence of recurrent DCIS, invasive breast cancer or skin can- cer. The results of a Phase II trial recently testing lapatinib for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer (early-stage invasive breast cancer and DCIS) showed that lapatinib (at 1,500 mg/day) decreased breast cancer cell proliferation in ER-negative tumors and in DCIS and ductal hyperplasia lesions (26). Another similar trial in women with HER2-positive or EGFR-positive DCIS breast cancer testing the effect of a lower dose of lapatinib (1,000 mg/day) is currently ongoing.
To date, the results from the preclinical and early clinical cancer prevention trials studying the effectiveness of EGFR inhibitors as viable preventive strategies for women with HER2-positive breast cancer are very promising. However, breast cancers that do not express ER, PR, or HER2, will not benefit from these targeted treatments.
In addition to HER2 inhibitors, HER2 peptide vaccines are being studied as therapeutic agents to induce immune responses
to HER2-positive breast cancers. Such HER2 vaccines may in the future be most useful for the prevention of HER2-positive breast cancers. HER2 antibodies have been shown to be present in pre- diagnostic breast cancer sera (47). This observation supports the development of anti-HER2 vaccine approaches using HER2 pep- tides as immunogens. Responses to these HER2 peptide vaccines are restricted to specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) classes: Class I (E75, GP2) and II (AE37) peptides simulate CD8- and CD4-positive T cells, respectively, and have been shown to induce an antitumor response (48). Results from Phase I and II clinical trials using these HER2 peptide vaccines have demon- strated significant immunologic ex vivo and in vivo responses (49, 50), and improved disease-free survival (particularly in patients with low-HER2 expression) persisting over time (51). In addi- tion, all of these studies have shown that anti-HER2 vaccination has minimal toxicity and is easily tolerated by women with prior breast cancer. The first Phase III clinical trial investigating the efficacy of an anti-HER2 vaccine (E37) given as adjuvant ther- apy to women with early-stage node-positive breast cancer (the Prevention of Recurrence in Early-Stage, Node-Positive Breast Cancer with Low to Intermediate HER2 Expression with Neu- Vax Treatment, or PRESENT, trial) is currently ongoing. Future studies will focus on testing whether these peptides will be use- ful in high-risk women for the prevention of HER2-positive breast cancer.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVE
Great progress has been made in the treatment and preven- tion of ER-positive breast cancer. Most recently, several breast cancer prevention trials targeting HER2 have demonstrated the preventive efficacy of HER2-targeting drugs. However, the iden- tification and develop of effective and safe targeted therapies for the prevention of TNBC remains challenging. This difficulty is exacerbated by the inherent heterogeneity of TNBC tumors, and underlines the necessity for subtype-specific multi-targeted approaches. Such combined strategies are critical for effective treatment and prevention of women with or at high risk of TNBC due to both the diverse signaling pathways driving the different molecular subtypes, as well as the presence of cancer stem cells, which are difficult to eradicate and are overrepresented in women with TNBC.
Successful clinical breast cancer prevention trials hinge upon the ability to identify high-risk individuals by breast cancer sub- type, who therefore carry a high-potential benefit for the agent(s) being tested in the study. However, educating women at risk for breast cancer about the risks and benefits of the different can- cer preventive drugs currently under investigation has been and remains challenging. Although a large population of women qual- ifies for these therapies, very few enroll in clinical breast cancer prevention trials. As the majority of these drugs is well-tolerated by breast cancer patients and are typically associated with only minor side effects, the consent, and participation of healthy high- risk women in clinical breast cancer prevention trials represents a major hurdle to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Effective reduction of breast cancer incidence in the years to come, particularly ER-negative and TNBC, ultimately depends upon the identification of novel targets, the development of non-toxic drugs that effectively interrupt the activity of those targets, and the deliv- ery of these preventive therapies to women at high-risk of breast cancers characterized by the targeted agents.

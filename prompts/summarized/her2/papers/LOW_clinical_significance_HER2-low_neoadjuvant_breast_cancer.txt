Discussion
Neoadjuvant therapy combined with anti- HER2 therapy is an effective treatment option for HER2-positive breast cancer (based on IHC defined as HER2-amplified IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ and ISH amplification). The heterogeneity of HER2 expression before and after neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer is an area of interest for clinicians and pathologists. HER2-low breast cancer is emerging as a new entity, leading to biological and clinical complexity. Currently, the evolution of HER2-low expression from primary breast cancer to residual breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy was assessed in a cohort by including the HER2-low category in the characterization of primary and post-neoadjuvant residual tumours.
In a cohort of 775 patients with pathological non-pCR breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy, HER2-low expressing breast cancers accounted for almost more than half (59.61%) of the entire HER2-negative cohort, which is consistent with available research data (8). Furthermore, in this cohort, the proportion of HER2-low cases in breast cancer samples with residual tumours after neoadjuvant therapy was lower than in breast cancer primaries, and the decrease in HER2-low cases in residual tumours after neoadjuvant therapy compared with breast cancer primaries was mainly due to the fact that HER2-low cases switched to HER2-zero with treatment.
The study showed an association between HR status and HER2-low. HER2-low expression consisted of 80.27% and 60.00% in the HR-positive/HER2-negative cohort and triple- negative cohort for primary breast cancer, respectively, and 74.14% and 53.23% in the HR-positive/HER2-negative cohort and triple-negative cohort for residual breast cancer after NAT, respectively. HER2-low cases were more common in the HR- positive/HER2-negative breast cancer cohort, while HER2-zero cases were more common in the TNBC cohort. This result is consistent with those in previous studies (9, 10) and Schettini et al (9) reported a higher incidence of HR-positive/HER2- negative phenotype than triple-negative phenotype in HER2- low breast cancer. ER levels were higher in the HR-positive/ HER2-negative subgroup than in the HER2-low cohort. In
conclusion, HR status is a key determinant of the underlying biology of HER2-low breast cancer. The complexity between HER2 and HR pathways may play a key role in biologically defining the HER2-low phenotype (11, 12) However, whether HER2-low can be considered as a separate subtype needs to be further validated in future studies.
Our main objective was to study the evolution of HER2- low from primary breast cancer to residual breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy. In the whole cohort, the HER2 noncompliance rate was 21.41%, mainly due to the switch from HER2-low to HER2-zero cases. In particular, approximately 17% of patients with HER2-low primary breast cancer exhibited conversion to HER2-zero after neoadjuvant therapy, whereas about 38% of patients with HER2-zero in the primary tumour switched to HER2- low, further confirming the instability of HER2-low expression. The great instability of HER2-low breast cancer was shown in the conversion from HER2-zero phenotype to HER2-low phenotype or from HER2-low phenotype to HER2-zero phenotype and with the use of ADC analogues (13). Therefore, re-testing for HER2 should be recommended for patients with breast cancer after undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. In addition, inconsistent HER2 low expression is primarily driven by the TNBC subgroup, which shows a higher conversion rate compared to the HR-positive/ HER2-negative subgroup, especially when considering the conversion of TNBC to the HER2-low phenotype. It should be considered that these patients have exhausted their primary treatment options, including hormonal strategies and chemotherapy after neoadjuvant therapy, but may still benefit from additional therapy. In such cases, those who exhibit low HER2 expression may be ideal candidates for inclusion in ongoing clinical trials of anti-HER2 ADCs. In contrast, although HER2-low expression was observed less frequently in triple-negative cohorts than in HR-positive cohorts, approximately 50% of TNBC patients
exhibited an HER2-low status. This result opens up new treatment decisions and opportunities for patients with TNBC.
In general, our findings emphasise the importance of re-testing for HER2 in breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant therapy. Indeed, low HER2 expression can be detected in breast cancer patients with primary HER2-zero after neoadjuvant therapy, thus expanding the treatment options for patients. However, it is unclear whether patients with HER2-low breast cancer who exhibit complete deletion of HER2 expression during disease evolution can still benefit from these new treatment strategies.
In addition, we analysed the pathological remission rates after neoadjuvant therapy in HER2-zero versus HER2-low cases to detect the difference between these two types. The main finding of our study was that HER2-zero and HER2-low expressing tumours are different biological subtypes with distinct clinicopathological features, including differences in HR-positive tumours and in pathological remission rates. Compared to HER2-zero cases, HER2-low cases had statistically different RCB grading, MP grading, and number of metastatic lymph nodes; the pathological remission rates were lower, and the number of metastatic lymph nodes was higher. We also analysed the clinicopathological characteristics of concordant cases (including HER2-zero and HER2-low cases) versus discrepant cases (including HER2-zero to HER2-low, and HER2-low to HER2-zero cases) in the HER2-
negative cohort. There were differences in histological staging, Ki- 67 index, MP grading, RCB grading, and number of lymph node metastases among the four groups of cases; the differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05).
The biological staging of breast cancer has always been based on HR status (HER2-negative and HER2-positive) (14). Our study not only confirmed the correlation between HER2 low and HR status, but also closely correlated with AR status. In addition, in order to confirm the correlation between low HER2 expression and AR positivity, we excluded the influence of HR status and conducted the study on the TNBC cohort. The incidence of HER2 low expression in AR positive cohort was significantly higher than that in AR negative cohort. This has not been shown in other studies.In breast cancer, these new subtypes can be distinguished by the standardized pathological assessment of HRs and HER2, especially in HER2-low breast cancer. This will lead to more complex breast cancer subtypes and provide new targeted therapeutic options to improve breast cancer prognosis.
This study also has certain limitations, because the collected cases were recent breast cancer patients, whose prognostic information was not obtained. Therefore, some biological characteristics of HER2-low breast cancer were not studied.
Conclusion
HER2-low breast cancer is highly unstable during disease evolution and has certain biological characteristics, and breast cancer with HER2-low positivity has certain biological characteristics, which are correlated with positive HR and positive AR. Whether HER2-low breast cancer can be regarded as a new subtype still needs to be confirmed by more studies. At the same time, re-detection of HER2 in breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy may bring new treatment opportunities for a certain proportion of patients.

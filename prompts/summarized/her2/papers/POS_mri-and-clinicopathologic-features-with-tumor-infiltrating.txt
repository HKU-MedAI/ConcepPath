Key Finding
In women with HER2-positive breast cancer, independent predictors of high TIL levels were histologic grade 3, tumor cellularity over 50%, and peritumoral edema on T2-weighted images (OR = 3.98, 4.59, and 2.83, respectively), though these differed between HR- negative/HER2-positive and HR-positive/HER2-positive cases; associated DCIS component was inversely associated with high TIL levels (OR = 0.16).
Importance
Preoperative assessment of TILs has potential implications for predicting treatment efficacy and guiding future immunotherapeutic approaches in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.

BACKGROUND. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are associated with therapeu- tic outcomes and prognosis in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. Identification of TIL levels is clinically relevant.
OBJECTIVE. The purpose of our study was to explore associations of clinicopatho- logic and MRI features with TIL levels in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.
METHODS. A total of 212 consecutive women (mean age, 54.0 years) diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer between January 2017 and December 2019 were includ- ed in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into low-TIL (< 10%) and high-TIL (≥ 10%) groups. Three breast radiologists independently reviewed images; interreader agreement was assessed, and the first reader’s findings were used for further analysis. Associations of clinicopathologic and MRI features with TIL levels were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Subanalysis of TIL levels by hormone receptor (HR) status was also performed.
RESULTS. A total of 115 (54.2%) patients had low TIL levels, and 97 (45.8%) patients had high TIL levels. A high TIL level was associated (all, p < .05) with histologic grade 3 (odds ratio [OR] = 3.98; frequency, 78.4% vs 52.2% in high- vs low-TIL groups, respective- ly), high tumor cellularity (OR = 4.59; median cellularity, 60% vs 50%), lower frequency of associated ductal carcinoma in situ (OR = 0.16; frequency, 86.6% vs 94.8%), and higher frequency of peritumoral edema on T2-weighted images (OR = 2.83; 71.1% vs 50.4%). In subgroup analysis by HR status, histologic grade 3 (OR = 5.03, p = .002) was a significant independent predictor of high TIL level in the HR-positive/HER2-positive group, where- as high tumor cellularity (OR = 9.06, p = .002), peritumoral edema (OR = 5.23, p = .03), and low ADC (OR = 11.69, p = .047) were independent predictors of high TIL level in the HR-negative/HER2-positive group. Interreader agreement for peritumoral edema was moderate among the three radiologists (к = 0.432–0.539).
CONCLUSION. Peritumoral edema on MRI and the histopathologic feature of tumor aggressiveness help predict high TIL levels in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. CLINICAL IMPACT. Pretreatment MRI features may serve as a useful tool for assess- ing TIL levels in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and for helping to classify pa- tients with variable clinical outcomes related to immune activity and to guide selection among neoadjuvant chemotherapy or HER2-targeted therapy or immunotherapy.

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous entity with complex genetic and molecular varia- tions [1]. Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor family. Overexpression of HER2 in breast cancer is associated with aggressive tumor biology and poor prognosis [2, 3]; however, the development of HER2-targeted therapeutic agents has resulted in im- proved survival of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer [4]. The treatment response of HER2-positive breast cancer varies, depending on tumor intrinsic subtypes, hormone receptor (HR) status, and antitumor immunity of the host [5].
Emerging studies on immune checkpoint molecules, which di- rectly modulate tumor-associated immune responses, report their potential to serve as prognostic markers and therapeutic targets [6, 7]. Moreover, antitumor immunity contributes to the effect of chemotherapy or HER2-targeted therapy [8, 9]. Understanding the role of immune-modulatory agents and their association with tu- mor biology would inform immune checkpoint blockade–based therapy and allow stratification of patients with breast cancer to the most effective therapy. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been identified as an important immunologic marker that reflects the adaptive immune response [10, 11]. TILs are frequent- ly observed in highly proliferative cancers, such as HER2-positive breast cancer or triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) [12], and elevated TIL levels are associated with improved therapeutic re- sponses and survival in both HER2-positive breast cancer and TNBC, but not in HR-positive breast cancer [8, 10, 13, 14]. Current- ly, evaluation of TIL levels is performed on histopathologic speci- mens that require invasive surgery or needle biopsy. Another dis- advantage of biopsy is that only a limited portion of the tumor is assessed. Thus, a noninvasive method that allows estimation of TIL levels of the entire tumor might help predict clinical outcomes in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer or TNBC who may un- dergo a range of therapies, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) or HER2-targeted therapy or immunotherapy.
Previous studies have investigated the utility of MRI features to predict TIL levels in breast cancer [15–18]. However, the associa- tion of MRI features and TIL levels remains poorly investigated in HER2-positive breast cancer [16]. Differences in clinicopatholog- ic behavior and interactions with the tumor microenvironment of HER2-positive breast cancer, depending on the tumor’s HR status, may influence the association of MRI features with TIL levels [19, 20]. In this study, we explored associations of clinicopathologic and MRI features with TIL levels in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, with attention to the role of HR status on this association.

Discussion
In this study, histologic grade of 3, tumor cellularity greater than 50%, and peritumoral edema on T2-weighted images were independently associated with high TIL levels in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer; associated DCIS component was inversely associated with high TIL levels. To our knowledge, the association between peritumoral edema on T2-weighted imag- es and TIL levels has not been previously reported. The peritu- moral microenvironment of an invasive breast cancer includes critical metabolic and immune changes and is associated with chemotherapy response, sentinel lymph node metastasis, tumor recurrence, and survival [29, 30]. Aggressive tumor growth leads to neoangiogenesis, increased vascular permeability, and the release of cytokines into the peritumoral region, which in turn results in peritumoral edema [31]. In this respect, both high in- filtrate of TILs and peritumoral edema may be more likely to be observed in highly proliferative tumors [32].
Our results are consistent with previous studies showing that breast cancers with high TIL levels show higher tumor aggressive- ness and a lower accompanying in situ component than those with low TIL levels [11, 15]. However, few studies have examined the utility of MRI features in assessing TIL levels in patients with breast cancer [16, 33, 34]. Murakami et al. [35] observed no asso- ciation between peritumoral edema and TIL levels (classified as low, intermediate, high) among women with TNBC or HER2-pos- itive breast cancer; in their study, a high SUVmax on PET/CT was positively correlated with TIL levels. Choi et al. [16] investigated MRI features associated with TIL levels in ER-negative/HER2-posi- tive breast cancer, although they did not assess peritumoral ede- ma; in their study, peak enhancement was independently asso-ciated with both low-TIL (< 10%) and high-TIL (> 50%) levels [16]. We stratified our study cohort into two groups on the basis of the study sample’s median TIL level (10%), yielding larger numbers of patients in each group in comparison with the studies by Muraka- mi et al. and Choi et al.
In our study, HER2-positive breast cancer with a high TIL level more commonly exhibited an ADC of 0.920 × 10−3 mm2/s or less. This association is consistent with the additional association be- tween high TIL level and tumor cellularity of greater than 50% in light of the association between ADC and tumor cellularity [36]. However, Çelebi et al. [33] and Fogante et al. [34] observed the opposite association—that is, an association of lower ADC in breast cancer with low TILs. Nonetheless, in both our study and the study by Shin et al. [37], ADC was not independently associat- ed with TIL levels in multivariable analysis. The variation between studies in terms of the role of ADC may relate to differences in study populations, DWI technique, and method for TIL level clas- sification. The role of ADC beyond other predictive markers re- mains uncertain and would be clarified by further investigations using standardized protocols.
The proportion of the washout component in the delayed phase was higher in the high-TIL group and the persistent-mi- nus-washout component was higher in the low-TIL group, simi- lar to the findings of the study by Ku et al. [17]. Kinetic features are important markers of tissue characterization that indicate tumoral neoangiogenesis and are associated with aggressive breast can- cer phenotypes [15, 38]. Other MRI features, including shape, mar- gin, and internal enhancement characteristics, were not signifi- cantly different between the high-TIL and low-TIL groups [16, 33].
Cases of HER2-positive breast cancer can be stratified by HR status determined from IHC staining [39]. Further, the clinico-pathologic behavior and imaging features of HER2-positive breast cancer differ by HR status [20, 40], and differing immu- nogenicity between the molecular subtypes of HER2-positive breast cancer seems to result in varying treatment respons- es [7]. The level of TILs is inversely correlated with HR status in HER2-positive breast cancer [20]. In our study, the clinicopatho- logic and MRI features associated with TIL levels were different between HR-positive and HR-negative cases. Among MRI fea- tures, only peritumoral edema and ADC were independently as- sociated with TIL levels in the HR-negative/HER2-positive group; no MRI features were independently associated with TIL levels in the HR-positive/HER2-positive group. The reason for this differ- ence is unclear from our study. It is possible that the reduced ge- netic heterogeneity of the HR-negative/HER2-positive group fa- cilitates identification of characteristic imaging features for the prediction of TILs [20]. Currently, all patients with HER2-positive breast cancer are treated with HER2-targeted therapy, but bio- logic heterogeneity should be considered when interpreting TIL levels and predicting relevant clinical outcomes for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.
A variety of cells (predominantly CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ helper T cells, T regulatory cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendrit- ic cells) contain TILs in breast cancer [24]. These cells represent dy- namic host immune activity, such as antitumor activity or antiin- flammatory response. Thus, TILs could be a meaningful surrogate marker of the host immune system for various malignancies, in- cluding breast cancer [41]. Clinical trials have shown that the TIL level is a favorable prognostic factor and is closely related to im- mune-mediated treatment responses in HER2-positive breast can- cer [8, 9, 42]. Thus, assessment of TILs before commencing treat- ment remains an area of interest in breast cancer precision therapy.
Our study has a number of limitations. First, we categorized patients by HR status based on IHC rather than genetic profiles. HR status determined via IHC staining is not fully concordant with the intrinsic molecular subtypes determined via gene expres- sion analysis; however, HR and HER2 status defined by the ASCO/ CAP guidelines is the reference standard for guiding therapeu- tic decisions and predicting patient prognosis in current prac- tice. Our rate of HR-positivity within patients with HER2-positive breast cancer was 59.0%, which is comparable to previous studies (51.8–66.3%) [43, 44]. Second, we did not separately assess spe- cific subsets of TILs, which represent different immune-modulat- ing activities; these methods are complex and variable among in- stitutions. Future studies should explore the importance of TIL subpopulations in HER2-positive breast cancer. Third, a single ex- perienced pathologist scored the stromal TILs according to the international guidelines for TIL assessment [24]; reproducibility of TIL levels was not evaluated. Fourth, the qualitative MRI find- ings are subjective, and agreement was moderate among most combinations of readers and features. Fifth, the single ROI placed within the tumor might not fully capture intratumoral heteroge- neity in comparison with histogram-based analysis [45]. Howev- er, consensus is lacking regarding the optimal method for ROI placement to assess TIL levels. Sixth, most patients underwent MRI after automated core needle or fine-needle aspiration biop- sy, leading to potential biopsy-related changes on MRI. However, the median time interval between biopsy and MRI was 21 days, which is longer than the interval in previous studies that investi- gated the prognostic value of peritumoral edema for other end- points [46, 47]. Seventh, the sensitivities and specificities of the independent predictors were low, indicating the need for con- tinued investigation and optimization before application of the markers in individual patients. Finally, the retrospective single tertiary center design led to a limited sample size.
In conclusion, histologic grade of 3, tumor cellularity of greater than 50%, and peritumoral edema on T2-weighted imaging are independently associated with high TIL levels in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, and associated DCIS component is inversely associated with high TIL levels. Among HR-negative/ HER2-positive cases, only tumor cellularity, peritumoral edema, and ADC are independently associated with high TIL, whereas among HR-positive/HER2-positive cases, only histologic grade is independently associated. Through validation with future stud- ies, pretreatment MRI features may serve as a useful tool for as- sessing TIL levels in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, helping to classify patients with variable clinical outcomes re- lated to immune activity and to guide selection among NAC or HER2-targeted therapy or immunotherapy.

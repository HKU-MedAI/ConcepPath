In light of the significant clinical benefits of novel HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugates in advanced HER2- low expressing breast cancers in recent phases I and III clinical trials, particularly trastuzumab-deruxtecan (T- Dxd), the new “HER2-low” category in breast cancers (breast cancer with a HER2 IHC score of 1+, or 2+ without gene amplification) has gained increasing attention. In the past year, “HER2-low” breast cancers have been under active investigation by both oncologists and pathologists. In this current review, we update the recent cutting- edge research on HER2-low breast cancers, with a focus on the biology of HER2-low breast cancers, the issues on the identification of HER2-low breast cancers by immunohistochemistry in current practice of pathology, and the future directions in this emerging category in breast cancers.

Introduction
The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in breast cancers represents the best example of tumor biomarkers with signifi- cant prognostic and therapeutic implications, and testing guidelines have been shifted and updated based on the evolving data in this field.1–3 Earlier results from clinical trials have shown that only patients with HER2-positive breast cancers benefit from the addition of HER2-directed therapies to standard chemotherapy.4–10 This led to the approval of HER2-targeted agents in breast cancers by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, tyro- sine kinase inhibitors (lapatinib, neratinib and tucatinib), and most recently trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) - the first generation of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapeutic interventions. The current binary HER2 scoring system classifies breast cancers into: 1) HER2 positive, when HER2 expression is scored either 3+ by immunohisto- chemistry (IHC) or 2+ by IHC with gene amplification tested by in-situ hybridization (ISH); and 2) HER2 negative, when HER2 expression is scored either 0+ or 1+ by IHC, or scored 2+ by IHC without ISH gene amplification.3
The binary categorization of HER2 status in breast cancers has been recently challenged by emerging evidence from the clinical trials.11–13 Phase I trials have demonstrated significant clinical benefits in advanced breast cancers with “HER2-low” expression (HER2 IHC score of 1+, or 2+ without gene amplification) associated with the use of novel HER2-directed ADCs, including trastuzumab-duocarmazine (SYD-985) and trastuzumab-deruxtecan (T-Dxd).11,12 Furthermore, recent results from a Phase III international clinical trial (DESTINY-Breast04) demonstrated that T-Dxd significantly improved the progression-free survival (PFS, median 9.9 vs 5.1 months) and overall survival (OS, median 23.4 vs 16.8 months) in patients with HER2-low expressing metastatic breast cancer who had received one or two previous lines of chemotherapy compared with physician’s choice of chemotherapy, irrespective of hormone receptor (HR) status.13 Risks of progression and death were reduced by 50% and 36% in patients treated with T-Dxd, respectively.13 These promising trial results will almost certainly lead to a significant change in the treatment landscape for breast cancers, and have garnished increasing attention for the addition of a HER2-low category (HER2 IHC score of 1+, or 2+ without gene amplification) (Fig. 1) in the evaluation of breast cancers. In a previous review article, our group introduced the evolving concepts of HER2-low breast cancers and discussed the challenges and unanswered questions regarding the accurate, reliable, and reproducible identification of HER2-low pa- tients.14 In the past year, the “HER2-low” category in breast cancers has been under active investigation by both oncologists and pathologists. In this current review, we update the recent cutting-edge research on HER2-low breast cancers, with a focus on the biology of HER2-low breast cancers, the issues regarding the identification of HER2-low breast cancers by IHC in current practice of pathology, and the future directions in this emerging category.

Current insights on HER2-low breast cancers
Currently, remarkable effort has been made to characterize the clinicopathologic and molecular features of HER2-low breast cancers. Schettini et al.15 first reported the clinicopathologic and PAM50 gene expression features in HER2-low breast cancers after retrospectively studying 3689 HER2-negative breast cancers from 13 independent datasets, including 1486 (40.3%) with a HER2 score of 0, 1489 (40.4%) with a HER2 score of 1+, and 714 (19.3%) with a HER2 score of 2+. The results from that study showed that HER2-low breast cancers had sig- nificant biological heterogeneity, were enriched in HR positive tumors and expressed higher ERBB2 and luminal-related genes than HER2-zero (HER2 IHC score of 0) tumors in HR positive tumors, while no gene was found differentially expressed in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) according to HER2 expression.15 Denkert et al.16 performed a pooled analysis of 2310 patient data from four prospective, neoadjuvant clinical trials, including 47.5% (1098) HER2-low (IHC 1+ and 2+ non-amplified) and 52.5% (1212) HER2-zero breast cancers. When compared to HER2-zero tumors, HER2-low breast cancers had signifi- cantly higher HR expression (64.0% vs 36.7%), were less responsive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with lower pathological complete response (pCR) rates (29.2% vs 39.0%), and had longer disease-free survival at 3 years (DFS, 83.4% vs 76.1%). Both the Schettini et al.15 and Denkert et al.16 studies were pooled-analysis of data from multiple, heterogeneous datasets enriched in either metastatic or neoadjuvant breast cancers. Our group was the first to report the baseline charac- teristics of HER2-low breast cancers in consecutive, real-world cases at initial diagnosis.17 Our results showed that HER2-low breast cancers accounted for 31.0% of cases by HercepTest and were more common in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive compared to ER-negative breast cancers (33.6% vs 15.0%), were generally clinical stages I–II (79.0%), ER-positive (93.1%), had homogenous HER2 staining (59.2%), HER2 IHC score of 1+ (87.4%), ductal phenotype (81.6%), histologic grades of 1 or 2 (94.2%), and were luminal molecular subtypes (94.3%). Addi-tional studies have also confirmed that HER2-low breast cancers
Agostinetto et al. found that ERBB2 mRNA expression levels in HER2-low breast cancers were between those found in the HER2- positive and HER2-zero breast cancers, and were higher in HER2-low/ HR positive tumors compared to HER2-low/HR negative tumors.18 In addition, HER2-low breast cancers may have increased prevalence of PIK3CA mutation (24.8% vs 16.3%) and reduced TP53 mutation (33.4% vs 44.0%), when compared to HER2-zero breast cancers.16 Zhang et al. studied the somatic mutation landscape in 523 Chinese breast cancer patients and revealed that HER2-low tumors had significantly more mutations involved in PI3K-Akt signaling pathways compared to HER2-positive and HER2-zero breast tumors.21 Table 1 lists the impor- tant findings of clinicopathologic and molecular features of HER2-low breast cancers from the current literature.

Is HER2-low a distinct clinical/biologic subtype or an emerging new therapeutic subtype of breast cancer?
Whether HER2-low breast cancer represents a distinct biologic/ clinical group in breast cancers, especially when compared to HER2-zero breast cancer, remains controversial in the current literature.16,17,20,23,26,27 For example, Denkert et al. demonstrated that HER2-low and HER2-zero breast cancers were distinct biological sub- types, with different clinicopathologic characteristics, with regard to HR positivity, tumor proliferation, tumor grading, response to NAC, and survival difference in therapy-resistant HR-negative breast cancers.16 Alves et al.20 also suggested that HER2-low tumors may be regarded as a distinct biological subtype, based on the significant differences between HER2-low and HER2-zero subgroups in terms of HR status, proliferation grade, and response to NAC, although in that study no difference in DFS and OS between these two groups was identified.20 Contrary to the Denkert et al.16 and Alves et al.20 studies, a study by de Moura Leite et al. of 855 patients did not support HER2-low as a biologically distinct breast cancer subtype, as there was no prognostic value with survival outcomes and no predictive effect for pCR after conventional NAC be- tween HER2-low and HER2-zero tumors.27 Of note, HR expression status plays an important role in the biology of HER2-low and HER2-zero tu- mors and should be considered when comparing the biological behavior between HER2-zero and HER2-low breast cancers. Does HER2-low expression have any prognostic value in breast cancers?
The prognostic significance of HER2 expression in HER2-low tumors has been evaluated retrospectively with conflicting results.16,18,19,23,24,26,28–33 Superior prognosis of HER2-low breast can- cers compared to HER2-zero tumors has been reported in several studies.16,23,25,28,33 Denkert et al.16 reported an improved survival rate in patients with HER2-low breast cancers compared to patients with HER2-zero breast cancer, particularly in patients with HR negative tu- mors.16 A large cohort analysis of 28,280 HER2 negative, non-metastatic breast cancers showed HER2-low breast cancers had better relapse-free survival (RFS) and OS than HER2-zero tumors.28 In that study superior outcomes were mainly observed for HER2 IHC1+ tumors compared to HER2-zero tumors.28 In contrast, several other studies have failed to demonstrate any prognostic values for HER2-low status in breast cancers.18,19,24,26,29–32 For example, in a retrospective analysis of 804 patients, Agostinetto et al. showed no significant differences in DFS and OS among HER2-low subtypes, even when paired by HR status.18 Horisawa et al. also reported no statistically significant differences in prognosis between HER2-low and HER2-zero patients, regardless of HR status, in a cohort of 4918 patients.30 Based on these conflicting results, no clear conclusions can be reached regarding the prognostic signifi- cance of low levels of HER2 expression at this time, and this is likely due to differences in patient population, study design/endpoint, and/or follow-up duration. A more definitive answer regarding whether HER2-low status is a contributing factor to disease prognosis or not will be difficult to assess without a prospective study that includs HR status and treatment protocols. 

Dynamic changes of HER2-low expression from primary to metastatic/ recurrent/NAC breast cancers
A few studies have found dynamic changes associated with HER2- low BCs in both primary breast cancers and matched samples of locoregional recurrences/distant metastases or post-NAC tumors. Miglietta et al. demonstrated that HER2-low expressions are highly unstable during disease evolution, with a 38.0% HER2 discordant rate between 547 matched primary and recurrent/distant metastatic breast cancers. Most of these discordant cases were driven by HER2-zero switching to HER2-low (15.0%) and HER2-low switching to HER2- zero (14.0%), particularly in the HR positive cases.34 Similar findings were also reported by Tarantino et al. in a study reporting significant discordance in HER2-low expression between primary tumors and matched advanced-stage biopsies, with enrichment in HER2-low tumors in the advanced setting. In that study there was significant discordance in HER2 expression between the primary breast cancer and its matched advanced stage biopsy, including 44.0% of the HER2-zero primary tu- mors showing an increased HER2 score on advanced stage biopsy, and 22.0% of the HER2-low primary tumors turning into HER2-zero on the advanced stage biopsy.35
The evolution of HER2-low expression has also been identified in breast cancers receiving NAC treatment. In a recent study, Miglietta et al. reported the overall rate of HER2 expression discordance was 26.4% between pre- and post-NAC treatment, mostly driven by HER2- negative cases converting either from the HER2-low phenotype (14.8%) or to the HER2-low phenotype (8.9%).36

Important issues on identifying HER2-low breast cancers by IHC in current pathology practice
Inter-observer variation on identifying HER2-low breast cancers by IHC
The definition of HER2-low breast cancers that has been employed in clinical trials relies on the IHC testing protocol and scoring system as laid out in the ASCO/CAP guidelines.3 According to the current HER2 testing guidelines in breast cancers, a HER2 score of 1+ refers to invasive tumor cells that have incomplete membrane staining that is faint/barely perceptible in >10% of tumor cells, while a HER2 score of 0 is defined as either no staining or the presence of membrane staining that is incom- plete and is faint/barely perceptible in ≤10% of tumor cells3 (Fig. 2). The inter-observer reproducibility, especially in cases in the low ranges (0 vs 1+) has been reinforced in several studies.15,37,38 Schettini et al.15 performed an inter-pathologist concordance analysis of HER2 staining in a subset 100 cases by 5 breast cancer-specialized pathologists. The result of that study showed 35 of 100 cases had discordant IHC scores and the discordances were as follows: 1+ vs. 0 (n = 15), 1+ vs. 2+ (n = 12), 2+ vs.0(n=1),3+vs.1+(n=1),and3+vs.2+(n=6)scores.15 Fer- nandez et al.37 evaluated the CAP survey data from more than 1400 laboratories around the world and found that the scoring accuracy for HER2 IHC in the low range (0 and 1+) was poor, and that 19.0% of cases read by the laboratories generated results with less than or equal to 70.0% concordance for a HER2 IHC score of 0 vs 1+. In a separate Yale cohort, 18 pathologists, without knowing the research purpose, read the scanned slides from a selected set of breast cancer biopsies, and there was only a 26.0% concordance between HER2 0 and 1+ compared with a 58.0% concordance between 2+ and 3+.37 Similarly, we have also found there is inter-observer variation among subspecialized breast pathologists in the evaluation of HER2 IHC, particularly in cases with 0 to 1+ HER2 IHC staining38 (Fig. 3). These studies demonstrate the challenges of using IHC as the primary assay in the real world to identify HER2-low breast cancer in a reproducible fashion. Until a more consistently reproducible methodology is available, careful evaluation of HER2 IHC with consensus between observers on challenging/bor- derline cases, as well as additional training, may be necessary for the accurate and reproducible evaluation of HER2-low breast cancers, in order to better stratify patients into groups who are more likely to benefit from the newer ADC therapeutic agents used to treat HER2-low breast cancers.
Inter-antibody variation on identifying HER2-low breast cancers by IHC
Currently, several commercially available, FDA-approved HER2 IHC testing kits have been used worldwide in clinical practice for the assessment of patients for whom trastuzumab may be a suitable treat- ment, including PATHWAY HER2 (clone 4B5; Ventana Medical Systems Inc., AZ, USA), HercepTest (Dako Denmark A/S, Denmark) and Oracle HER2 (clone CB11; Leica Biosystems, Germany). All of these IHC assays were developed for use in identifying HER2 positive breast cancers; however, the discriminatory capabilities of these reagents in the lower end of their dynamic range are less well defined. Earlier studies have demonstrated fair to moderate agreement with an absolute agreement rate of 58.0% (kappa value: 0.39–0.44) between the HercepTest and 4B5 assays among three board-certified anatomic pathologists using the ASCO/CAP 2013 guidelines for breast cancers.39 A preliminary study by Scott et al. reported that the Ventana 4B5 antibody clone identified a higher proportion of HER2-low cases than HercepTest (27.4% vs 9.2%) in a subset analysis of 500 cases.40 In the Destiny-Breast04 trials, the Ventana HER2/neu (4B5) IUO (investigational use only) clone was used for HER2 testing, and for selecting patients who were eligible for enrollment in the clinical trial.13 Currently, it is uncertain whether any differences in the sensitivity of different IHC antibodies used for eval- uation of HER2 status creates significant variability between assays and laboratories in this HER2-low range, and whether the Ventana 4B5 IHC assay used in the Destiny-Breast04 trial will be the most suitable and only companion diagnostic assay for aiding in identifying HER2-low breast cancers for whom treatment with T-Dxd is being considered. 
In a commentary article, Allison and Wolff also emphasized the critical issues that remain regarding the fitness of IHC assays for iden- tifying HER2-low breast cancers including: (1) Can a reference standard be set to validate an IHC assay’s ability to distinguish between IHC zero and IHC nonzero HER2 staining?; (2) How dependent is HER2 IHC 0 vs 1+ staining on pre-analytic factors, such as cold ischemic time, formalin fixation time, and time since an unstained section is cut from the tissue block?; (3) How much does tissue heterogeneity affect a HER2 IHC score of 0 vs 1+; and (4) How many samples should be used to be certain there is HER2 1+ staining in at least 10% of tumor cells?

Future directions
Accurately defining HER2-low breast cancers for patient selection
The current definition of HER2-low breast cancer is largely based on the inclusion criteria of patients enrolled in the previously mentioned clinical trials, and may not be an adequate representation of the ideal target population. Preliminary results from a phase II study (DAISY) reported a response rate of 30.6% to T-Dxd treatment in breast cancer patients with HER2 IHC score of 0 (vs. 69.1% in HER2-positve tumors, 33.3% in HER2-low tumors).42 The DESTINY-Breast06 trial (NCT04494425), which is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of T-Dxd in metastatic HER2-low/HR-positive breast cancer patients whose disease has progressed on endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting, is actively recruiting breast cancer patients with HER2-low BCs and HER2 IHC expression of >0 and <1+. This study will have important implications for helping to determine the lower limits or threshold levels of HER2 expression required to benefit from an ADC therapeutic approach, as well as further defining the clinical importance of distinguishing HER2-low from HER2-zero breast cancers by current testing methods. Future studies to correlate between the patient response to novel ADCs and HER2 expression in clinical trial datasets would also be very helpful to better define HER2-low breast cancer. In our opinion, we believe that the definition of HER2-low breast cancers will continue to evolve based on the development of new drugs, the results of future clinical trials, and the development of more sensitive and reliable testing methodologies, as well as our understanding of HER2-low expressing breast cancers.

Developing quantitative methods in identifying HER2-low breast cancers
Due to the potential limitations of IHC/ISH in identifying lower levels of HER2 expression, it will in all likelihood be necessary to improve our ability to accurately detect patients with HER2-low breast cancer at the lower levels of HER2 expression who might benefit from new anti-HER2 agents. Developing reliable and accurate quantitative laboratory methods for identifying HER2-low breast cancers has also been under active investigation. Kennedy et al. reported a method of immunoaffinity-enrichment coupled to multiple reaction monitoring- mass spectrometry (immuno-MRM-MS) to quantify the HER2 protein (as peptide GLQSLPTHDPSPLQR) in both frozen and formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) breast cancer biopsies. Their results demon- strated that the immuno-MRM-MS assay has acceptable analytical characteristics, high concordance with predicate assays, and enables precise, relative quantification of HER2 expression, even at low expression levels.43 Moutafi et al. recently reported a quantitative immunofluorescence coupled with a mass spectrometry standardized HER2 array to measure absolute amounts of HER2 protein in atto- mol/mm2 on conventional histology sections.44 Xu et al. found that IHC methods have a comparatively limited dynamic range for measuring HER2 expression, especially in HER2-negative patients, while the range of expression based on RNA abundance suggests that a molecular method defining HER2-low cancers may better serve the treatment decision needs of this group.45 These preliminary investigations have opened the doors for studies of clinically validated quantitative labo- ratory methods in facilitating patient selection for newer therapeutic agents used to treat HER2-low breast cancers. In addition, other previously-reported quantitative methods for detecting HER2 protein expression in clinical FFPE materials, including the streptavidin-coated phosphor integrated dot fluorescent nanoparticles (PIDs) ,46 the immunofluorescence-based automated quantitative analysis method,47 HERmark Breast Cancer assay48–50 and quantitative IHC method51 may also be useful platforms for identifying HER2-low breast cancer. Nevertheless, any new quantitative methods on HER2 protein detection will also need to undergo extensive analytic and clinical validation to demonstrate level 1 evidence of clinical utility before approval for use in clinical practice.
Testing samples for ensuring not missing HER2-low breast cancers
Earlier studies comparing ER, progesterone receptor and HER2 analysis on core biopsy specimens and paired excisional samples have shown comparable results.52,53 In the current clinical practice, these biomarkers are usually tested on the core biopsy material at the time of initial breast cancer diagnosis, with repeat testing on the excision in certain circumstances.3 With the addition of the HER2-low category in breast cancers, the distinction of subtle difference between HER2 0 and 1+ becomes crucial. The biologic heterogeneity of HER2-low breast cancers has been well established in previous studies,15,18 and our group recently reported that approximately 40% of HER2-low breast cancers had heterogeneous HER2 IHC staining.17 It is unclear whether repeating HER2 on the excisional material is needed when the initial HER2 result has an IHC score of 0. Studies examining this issue will be very valuable for guiding the future practice.
The biology of HER2-low breast cancers
Although remarkable effort has been made to understand the biology of HER2-low breast cancers, the biological complexity and heterogene- ity of HER2-low breast cancers are still far from being understood. In addition, there is no solid evidence to date supporting HER2-low status in breast cancers as an independent prognostic factor and as a distinct biologic/clinical entity. Further studies focusing on clinicopathologic and molecular biomarkers that may possibly affect the response of HER2-low breast cancers to the new ADCs should be considered.
Conclusions
In light of the exciting results from recent clinical trials of novel HER2-targeting ADCs, especially trastuzumab-deruxtecan (T-Dxd) in HER2-low expressing breast cancers, HER2-low breast cancers are now under active investigation. Consistent clinicopathologic and molecular features of HER2-low breast cancers have been revealed from both pooled-analysis of large cohorts and smaller single-institutional studies, such as HER2-low breast cancers are enriched in HR positive breast cancers, are mainly luminal molecular subtypes, and are less responsive to NAC with lower pCR rates; however, the biology of HER2-low breast cancer is far from being elucidated. HER2 testing will likely be shifted to focus on the distinction of true negative versus HER2-low, or even ultra- low (HER2 IHC >0 <1+ expression) breast cancers. More accurate and reliable methods are needed to better define the most appropriate pa- tient population for treatment. Further studies are still largely needed, including, but not limited to: 1) standardization of IHC testing tech- niques with the development of more accurate and reliable testing methods that ensure accurate identification of patients with HER2-low breast cancers; 2) establishing a more accurate and reproducible defi- nition of HER2-low breast cancers; and, 3) gaining a better under- standing of the biology of HER2-low breast cancers.

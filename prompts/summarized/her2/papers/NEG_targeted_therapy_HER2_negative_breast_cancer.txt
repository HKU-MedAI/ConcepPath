Breast cancer has an extremely high incidence in women, and its morbidity and mortality rank first among female tumors. With the increasing development of molecular biology and genomics, molecular targeted therapy has become one of the most active areas in breast cancer treatment research and has also achieved remarkable achievements. However, molecular targeted therapy is mainly aimed at HER2-positive breast cancer and has not yet achieved satisfactory curative effect on HER2-negative breast cancer. This article describes the potential targets that may be used for breast cancer treatment from the aspects of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, DDR, angiogenesis, the cell cycle, breast cancer stem cells, etc., and explores possible inhibitors for the treatment of HER2-negative breast cancer, such as PI3K inhibitors, AKT inhibitors and m-TOR inhibitors that inhibit the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that restrain angiogenesis, CDK inhibitors, aurora kinase inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors that block cell cycle, as well as the drugs targeting breast cancer stem cells which have been a hit, aiming to provide a new idea and strategy for the treatment of HER2-negative breast cancer.

BACKGROUND
Breast cancer is the most common female malignant tumor worldwide, and it is also the main cause of death of women from cancer. Its morbidity and mortality are still rising, and the trend is getting younger (1), so the exploration of the occurrence, development and treatment of breast cancer has long been a hot spot of global concern (2).
After gene and protein level detection, breast cancer is divided into five molecular subtypes according to the characteristics of gene and protein expression: normal-like breast cancer, luminalA, luminalB, HER2-enriched breast cancer (HER2-E) and basal-like breast cancer, namely triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (3). HER2 expressed in HER2-enriched and part of luminalB breast cancer is the membrane receptor encoded by the proto-oncogene ERBB2, which is a member of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ERB) family of tyrosine kinase receptors (4). HER2-negative breast cancer refers to normal-like breast cancer, luminalA, partial luminalB and basal-like type. Currently, the treatment methods for breast cancer include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and targeted therapy (5). LuminalA and luminalB respond well to hormone therapy, while HER2-E has been developed to target HER2. Basal-like drugs are highly invasive and there is currently no molecular-based targeted therapy (6). In addition, surgical resection combined with chemotherapy is still the main method for the treatment of breast cancer, but such treatment has serious side effects and serious physical and mental impact on patients. Targeted therapy has the advantages of strong specificity, significant efficacy and small side effects, and is an effective choice among many clinical treatment plans (7). For patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, several new targeted drugs have been specifically used for the treatment in the past 10 years, including the application of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, which have significantly improved the survival rate of patients, indicating that targeted therapy is a powerful means for the treatment of breast cancer (8). Table 1 shows the five molecular subtypes, gene expression profiles and treatment strategies of breast cancer (6). It can be seen that HER2- targeted drugs are only effective for a small number of breast cancer patients and have no obvious effect on the majority of breast cancer patients. Therefore, the application of targeted drugs is still limited at present.
Most of the special expression molecules of different subtypes in the table are used for breast cancer typing, such as the expression of GENES and proteins related to K67 and HR, while other molecules that are different from the expression of HER2-E can serve as potential targets for the treatment of HER2-negative breast cancer (9–11). For example, CK8/18 and GATA3, which can regulate the cell metastasis process including ZEB2, are closely related to the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer and can be treated from the cell cycle and EMT pathway (12, 13). EGFR and FGFR1 have a regulatory effect on the generation of new blood vessels, and many angiogenesis inhibitors targeting these targets have been clinically used (14).
Exploring innovative target drugs other than HER2 and specifically targeting breast cancer with negative HER2 expression is the development trend of today’s breast cancer treatment and also one of the most challenging issues in the treatment of breast cancer (15). Therefore, we mainly provide an overview illustrating potential targets or signaling pathways using to treat breast cancer, so as to provide references for the clinical application of targeted therapy for HER2-negative breast cancer.

CONCLUSION
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the main cause of death from cancer in women. With the development of molecular biology and genomics, molecular targeted therapy has become one of the most active areas in the treatment research of breast cancer, and it has also achieved remarkable achievements. At present, targeted therapy has become a brand new biological treatment method in addition to the four traditional treatment modes of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and endocrine therapy.
However, today’s targeted therapy drugs mainly target HER2- positive breast cancer. The advent of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib and other drugs has significantly improved the prognosis of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (152). The drugs approved for the treatment of HER2-negative breast cancer and related information are listed in Table 3. It can be seen that targeted drugs for HER2-negative breast cancer, especially TNBC, are relatively less selective, and there are still many problems waiting to be solved. For example, the efficacy of single-agent therapy is not satisfactory, the price is expensive, which increases the economic burden of patients, and the target selectivity is so low that it is prone to high toxicity (153). Therefore, it is necessary to continuously develop and research more accurate and efficient new drugs that can also reverse drug resistance.
The most widely used targeted drugs for HER2-negative breast cancer are DDR inhibitors, especially PARP inhibitors, which have shown good efficacy in treatment of TNBC (54). In addition, as most chemotherapy drugs work by destroying DNA of breast cancer cells, DDR inhibitors can not only inhibit breast cancer cells, but also improve their sensitivity to such chemotherapy drugs. The combination of the two drugs can achieve twice the result with half the effort.
Inhibitors targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway, angiogenesis and blocking of the cell cycle are already under development. Studies have shown that the therapeutic effect of inhibitors targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway is more obvious in patients with high levels of phosphorylated AKT, loss of PTEN protein and mutations of PTEN or PIK3CA genes. Unfortunately, these inhibitors are obstructed by the high incidence of adverse reactions such as diarrhea, neutropenia, and pneumonia (38). Currently, angiogenesis inhibitors are mainly used in patients with HER2- positive breast cancer, and their efficacy in patients with HER2- negative breast cancer should be further studied. CDK 4/6 inhibitors have brought new hope for breast cancer treatment. Multiple studies have confirmed that this inhibitor combined with endocrine therapy can significantly improve the survival of patients with HR-positive and HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (154–156). Nevertheless, many current studies attach importance to improving the resistance of breast cancer cells to CDK 4/6 inhibitors. It is hoped that these inhibitors can be further used in the treatment of breast cancer (157, 158).
Due to the high selectivity and low toxicity of stem cells, the therapy targeting stem cells has become a hot topic in recent years. MSCs, lncRNA and miRNA in HER2-negative breast cancer treatment have important application value (159), in addition, the new technology such as nanometers provides a new drug delivery system, which can improve drug efficacy and reduce drug side effects at the same time.
Factly, all drugs for the treatment of HER2-negative breast cancer do not only act on a single pathway, but rather, a single drug can regulate multiple pathways (160), such as the recently widely studied effects of statins on breast cancer.
Statins are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, which are often used to reduce cholesterol levels and prevent coronary heart disease in clinical practice (161). In recent years, it has been found that statins have significant efficacy in the treatment of tumors, especially for ER-positive breast cancer (162, 163). A large number of statins, such as simvastatin, lovastatin and fluvastatin, can inhibit the proliferation and migration of breast cancer. The mechanisms related to their therapeutic effects include inhibition of PI3K/Akt and PPTG1 signaling pathways, activation of LKB1-AMPK-P38MAPK-p53-survivin cascade resulting in cell death, and increased caspase-3-mediated vimentin hydrolysis leading to the death of breast cancer cells (164–167), indicating that it achieves the purpose of breast cancer treatment by regulating multiple signaling pathways.
With the rapid development of modern technology and biomedicine, the treatment concept of breast cancer is constantly updated. In recent years, breast cancer is considered as a systemic disease, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy has also been included as an important part of the treatment of HER2- negative breast cancer (168). At the same time, the treatment and drugs for HER2-negative breast cancer are also undergoing comprehensive innovation, with more influencing factors being included in the development of new drugs (160, 169). In addition, more studies are promoting the clinical treatment towards the direction of “precision”.
Precision medicine is based on personal genomic information, combined with proteome, metabolome and other relevant internal environment information, to tailor the best treatment plan for patients, in order to maximize the therapeutic effect and minimize side effects. The study of gene expression profiles of various subtypes of breast cancer and the expression of specific target molecules, as well as the discovery of specific targeted therapeutic measures, can further realize the goal of “personalized medicine”.
In HER2-negative breast cancer treatment, more studies on the combination of targeted therapies with other therapies need to be carried out, in order to further study the effectiveness, safety and economics of the combined application of targeted drugs and chemotherapy drugs, so as to maximize the efficacy of targeted breast cancer therapy, which may become a new direction for the treatment of breast cancer patients in the future.

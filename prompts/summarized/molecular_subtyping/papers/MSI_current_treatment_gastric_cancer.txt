Diagnosis and Staging
Patients with newly diagnosed gastric cancer often present with an upper endoscopy report performed for symptoms including dyspepsia and reflux, but also with symptoms or signs that may indicate advanced disease such as dysphagia, weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, and emesis.13 Clear measurements of the extent of the primary tumor are often lacking, and repeat endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can provide additional clinical staging. Endoscopic ultrasound is most beneficial in identifying the rare early tumor (T1) that may benefit from endoscopic resection or upfront surgery. Most tumors are T2–4, however, and there are known limitations in the ability of EUS, and imaging, to accurately identify nodal metastases.14 Standard chest/abdomen/pelvic CT scans are often sufficient for imaging, but FDG-PET/CT scans can be considered for specific clinical indications such as further evaluation of indeterminate lesions. Tumors with poorly differentiated, signet ring cell type histology, or those without mucinous features, often do not demonstrate increased uptake on PET-CT imaging.15
Staging laparoscopy with peritoneal washings are a critical component of the initial workup as carcinomatosis is identified in approximately 20% of patients without imaging evidence of peritoneal disease.16 In addition, positive peritoneal cytology only is identified in approximately another 10% of patients, which also represents stage IV disease.16 Although only assigned a Category 2B recommendation in current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines (which indicates there is not uniform NCCN consensus that the procedure is appropriate such as found in a 2A recommendation), the procedure is considered standard at many cancer centers due to the obvious implications of identifying stage IV radiologically occult disease at diagnosis.17 The risks of staging laparoscopy
are low and the outpatient procedure can also be combined with port placement for prompt initiation of systemic therapy. If the staging laparoscopy is deferred until the time of attempted resection after preoperative therapy, the identification of stage IV disease represents progression of disease when it was possibly present at the time of diagnosis.18 Appropriate initial staging at diagnosis has clear systemic therapy implications, can prevent unnecessary delays while awaiting surgery, and can also promote access to clinical trials. Most importantly, however, is that patients deserve a clear understanding of the extent of their disease and potential for cure as early as possible in their treatment plan.
A relatively new development in the workup of patients with potentially resectable disease is consideration of micro-satellite instability (MSI) testing at diagnosis. There are several studies providing a signal that patients with MSI-high cancers may have an adverse oncologic outcome when treated with standard systemic chemotherapy approaches.19 In
a secondary post hoc analysis of the MAGIC trial, compared to patients with MSS/MSI- low tumors, those with MSI-high tumors had improved survival with surgery alone and inferior survival with perioperative chemotherapy plus surgery.20 Similarly, a post-hoc analysis of the CLASSIC trial showed that patients with resected MSI-high tumors
did not have a disease-free survival (DFS) benefit with adjuvant chemotherapy.21 In a pooled meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials of resected gastric cancer, MSI- high status was associated with longer overall survival (OS) and lack of benefit with perioperative or adjuvant chemotherapy.19 Some centers are recommending upfront surgery for patients with MSI-high tumors and even consideration of preoperative immunotherapy for advanced locoregional disease. The role of perioperative immune checkpoint blockade or omission of chemotherapy in operable MSI-H tumors has not been prospectively assessed. KEYNOTE-585 is a phase 3 randomized double-blind study assessing the addition of pembrolizumab to perioperative chemotherapy in resectable gastroeosphageal cancers (NCT03221426), and this may provide data on the role of checkpoint blockade in the
subset of patients with MSI-H cancers. These complex cases are best approached in a multidisciplinary fashion with input from medical, radiation, and surgical oncology.
National guidelines recommend a multidisciplinary team approach for therapeutic decisions for patients with gastric cancer.17 At least once a week meetings are encouraged with individuals from relevant disciplines to include gastroenterology, radiology, pathology, and medical, surgical, and radiation oncology. Review of pathology and imaging is often helpful and not infrequently identifies findings that can change treatment or require further workup. In addition, review of patient outcomes and novel studies can provide an excellent source of continued medical education.

High Microsatellite Instability/Mismatch Repair-Deficient Tumors
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network performed a comprehensive molecular characterization of 295 untreated gastric adenocarcinomas and categorized gastric cancer into four subtypes – MSI-H tumors, EBV positive tumors, tumors exhibiting chromosomal instability (CIN), and genomically stable tumors.50 In this analysis of untreated tumors, 22% were MSI-H, however the incidence in metastatic disease has been reported to be much lower, only 3% in a recent cohort of patients with stage IV disease.51
Mismatch repair (MMR) genes are responsible for fixing errors that occur during deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication. Tumors with defects in the mismatch repair system (MMR deficient, dMMR) harbor significantly more mutations than tumors with intact mismatch repair machinery (MMR proficient, pMMR). Mismatch repair deficient tumors are vulnerable to mutations in microsatellites, repetitive sequences of nucleotide bases found throughout the genome, leading to high levels of microsatellite instability. Across tumor types, patients with dMMR cancers are more likely to respond to PD-1 blockade than are pMMR cancers.52 In part, this is due to high levels of neoantigens and PD-L1 positive T cell infiltration in dMMR tumors.
Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-1 activity by binding to PD-1 receptors on T-cells, thereby blocking PD-1 ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) from binding. PD-1 blockade results in removal of the physiologic brake on an active immune system and induces antitumor response. KEYNOTE-158 was a phase 2 trial
that enrolled patients with treatment refractory non-colorectal MSI-H/dMMR cancers to receive pembrolizumab.53 Of the 24 patients with gastric cancer, there were 11 responses (including four complete responses) and median PFS was 11 months. This trial ultimately led to the tissue-agnostic FDA approval of pembrolizumab for patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR of any solid tumor type, including gastric cancer, that progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment.54
Prospective tumor sequencing of patients with metastatic gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma has demonstrated patients with MSI-H tumors are chemotherapy resistant and more likely to obtain durable responses to immunotherapy.51 An analysis of patients with MSI-H gastric cancers enrolled to KEYNOTE-59, KEYNOTE-061, and KEYNOTE-062, found that both OS and PFS were prolonged with pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to chemotherapy and that pembrolizumab is more effective than chemotherapy in the first line setting.55

Tumor Mutation Burden
Gastric cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases with variable responsiveness to immunotherapy. Many biomarkers have been examined to identify susceptibility to PD-1 blockade including MSI status and PD-L1 expression as discussed. Tumor mutation burden is another biomarker currently under investigation. TMB quantifies the number of somatic mutations per coding area of a genome. It has been hypothesized that a heavily mutated tumor can produce a large number of neoantigens resulting in T-cell infiltration and potentially increased responsiveness to checkpoint blockade.
In June 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval for treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic TMB-high (TMB-H, ≥10 mutations/megabase (mt/Mb)) solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. This was based upon a prospectively-planned retrospective analysis of previously treated patients with advanced solid tumors and TMB-H enrolled to KEYNOTE-158. In this non-randomized trial, of 790 evaluable patients, 102 (13%) were TMB-H and had an ORR of 29%, with a median DoR not reached.63
In an exploratory analysis from KEYNOTE-061, there was a positive association between TMB determined by FoundationOne CDx and clinical outcomes in patients with gastric cancer treated with pembrolizumab, but not paclitaxel.64 In patients with TMB ≥10 mut/Mb, pembrolizumab demonstrated an OS benefit compared to paclitaxel, and this benefit persisted even when MSI-H patients were excluded. These findings are hypothesis generating. In contrast, a retrospective analysis of genomically profiled gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas found that while survival was associated with increasing TMB, this association was lost after multivariate analysis and exclusion of MSI-H patients.65

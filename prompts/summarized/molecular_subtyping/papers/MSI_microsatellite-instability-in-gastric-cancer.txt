Gastric cancer is one of the most aggressive malignancies, with limited treatment options in both locally advanced and meta- static setting, resulting in poor prognosis. Based on genomic characterization, stomach tumour has recently been described as a heterogeneous disease composed by different subtypes, each of them with peculiar molecular aspects and specific clinical behaviour. With an incidence of 22% among all western gastric tumour cases, stomach cancer with microsatellite instability was identified as one of these subgroups. Retrospective studies and limited prospective trials reported differences between gastric cancers with microsatellite stability and those with instability, mainly concerning clinical and pathological features, but also in regard to immunological microenvironment, correlation with prognostic value, and responses to treatment. In particular, gastric cancer with microsatellite instability constitutes a small but relevant subgroup associated with older age, female sex, distal stomach location, and lower number of lymph-node metastases. Emerging data attribute to microsatellite instability status a favourable prognostic meaning, whereas the poor outcomes reported after perioperative chemotherapy administration suggest a detrimental role of cytotoxic drugs in this gastric cancer subgroup. The strong immunogenicity and the widespread expression of immune-checkpoint ligands make microsatellite instability subtype more vulnerable to immunotherapeutic approach, e.g., with anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA4 antibodies. Since gastric cancer with microsatellite instability shows specific features and clinical behaviour not overlapping with microsatellite stable disease, microsatellite instability test might be suitable for inclusion in a diagnostic setting for all tumour stages to guarantee the most targeted and effective treatment to every patient.

Introduction
Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common tumours and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1]. The addition of targeted drugs to the established chemo- therapeutic scenario of treatment has determined a modest improvement in overall survival, but, unfortunately, the prog- nosis remains poor [2–4]. Emerging data suggest that patients’ outcomes do not only depend on staging but also on specific molecular and histopathologic tumour features [5, 6]. Indeed, two detailed genomic characterizations of gastric cancer have recently been developed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Asian Cancer Research Group (ACRG) [5, 6], proving that GC is a complex and heterogeneous disease. According to TCGA genomic characterizations, GC can be divided into four subgroups (Table 1): (1) tumours positive for Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) infection; (2) microsatellite insta- bility-high tumours (MSI-H); (3) genomically stable tumours (GS); (4) tumours with chromosomal instability (CIN) [5, 6]. Interestingly, the MSI-H subgroup was identified as a sepa- rate entity of GC in both of these classifications [5, 6], with a reported incidence in the western population of 22% [5]. The frequency of MSI across gastrointestinal cancers and tumours of other districts with high prevalence of MSI (>10%) are summarized in Table 2. Microsatellites are short and repetitive DNA sequences randomly widespread throughout the genome [5, 7, 8]. The mismatch repair system deficiency (MMRD) is generally caused by germline mutations or sporadic epigenetic silencing that lead to insertion or deletions of nucleotides in the microsatellite regions during DNA replication; these phe- nomena are known as microsatellite instability (MSI) [9–11]. Although the role of MSI-H in colorectal cancer as a predictive and prognostic factor is well established [12–16], the correla- tion between MSI, and clinical and pathological features in GC remains ambiguous, with a few available data from prospective trials [17–20]. Interestingly, recent studies have hypothesized that alterations in the mismatch repair (MMR) system may predict clinical benefit for treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, due to a positive correlation between MSI-H and PD-L1 expression, as shown in Fig. 1 [21–24]. In this review, the current evidences about microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) gastric cancer (GC) are summarized, with a special focus on pathological characteristics, predictive and prognostic values, and future perspectives for clinical approaches of MSI-H GC subgroup.

Diagnosis of MSI
The increasing knowledge about the prognostic and predic- tive role of MSI-H vs MSS in several cancer subtypes has led to a larger number of patients routinely tested for this molecular feature [32]. Gastrointestinal and non-gastroin- testinal cancers with high prevalence of MSI-H (≥ 10%) are summarized in Table 2. For an accurate determination of MSI status and the subsequent therapeutic decision, sen- sitive, fast, and precise techniques are necessary [30–32]. Currently, several different methods are validated and in use to detect an MMR deficient cancer:
1. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of micro- satellite sequences;
2. immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for expression of MMR proteins;
3. next-generation sequencing (NGS) for detection of MSI.
MSI evaluation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
PCR amplification with specific primers for microsatel- lite repeats results in a distinctive amplification profile [30, 34]. By comparing the allelic position of the microsatellite locus in tumour and normal tissue, MSI can be assessed as “shift” in the pherogram of one or more microsatellites as illustrated in Fig. 2. To reach high specificity and sensi- tivity and also to ensure reproducibility and standardiza- tion between different laboratories, The National Cancer Institute recommends the so-called Bethesda Panel as ref- erence for diagnostic testing [7]. This panel is composed of five microsatellite markers specific for two mononucleo- tide loci (BAT-25 and BAT-26) and three dinucleotide loci (D2S123, D5S346, and D17S250) [7, 29]. These regions are amplified in parallel using fluorescent PCR and their sizes are evaluated by subsequent capillary electrophoresis [34]. Using this method, three different stati can be estab- lished based on different allelic size patterns in the cancer tissue compared to the normal one. The MSI-high (MSI-H) status is given by a shift in size in at least two of the five microsatellite loci; MSI-low (MSI-L) is given by a shift in size in one locus out of five and microsatellite stable (MSS) with any shift in cancer tissue compared to the normal one [7, 30, 34]. The dinucleotide markers were demonstrated to be less sensitive and specific than mononucleotide for the detection of tumours with mismatch repair deficiencies [35]. Furthermore, mononucleotide markers are more com- monly quasi-monomorphic, potentially obviating the need to test the corresponding normal DNA. [7]. To overcome the limitations of Bethesda system due to the presence of
dinucleotide markers, a commercial available panel has recently been developed by Promega Corporation. This is commonly employed in the diagnostic practice and replaced dinucleotides of the Bethesda Panel with mononucleotide markers (NR-21, NR-24, and MONO-27, see Fig. 2) helping to resolve cases of MSI-low into either MSI-H or MSS by comparison of tumour and the surrounding normal tissue as illustrated in Fig. 2 [7, 35].

MSI evaluation by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Immunohistochemistry staining allows detection of expression or total absence of MMR proteins and relative scoring is possible. This method shows comparable perfor- mance characteristics and high concordance rate (> 90%) with MSI detection with PCR [8]. The loss of expression of a single protein or of a heterodimeric couple of the MMR complex suggests the presence of MMRD; thus, it is an indirect evidence of MSI. On protein level, hMLH1 and hMSH2 are stable without their respective dimeric partners’ hPMS2 and hMSH6, whereas these latter compo- nents are rarely stable without their counterparts [17, 28, 30]. Therefore, tumours with mutated hMLH1 or hMSH2 genes usually show loss of the respective functional dimer; conversely, mutations of hPMS2 or hMSH6 genes gen- erate loss of only the affected protein [28, 30]. Hence, IHC allows the determination which of the MMR genes is defective and supports the decision about further genetic analysis [30, 34]. It must be taken into account that IHC provides misleading information for those rare cases of missense mutations in hMLH1 or hMSH6 genes, resulting in translated proteins with normally antibody affinity but missing enzymatic activity. In these cases, only PCR-based MSI testing can help to determine whether there are true functional MMR proteins through these mutations [7, 11].
Comparison between MSI testing via PCR and IHC
Many studies have attempted to evaluate and compare the best and cost-effective method in defining the MMR status between IHC and PCR [7, 8, 36]. Moreover, it has been evidenced in many reports the high correlation between IHC results and PCR-based tests in determining the phe- notypic trait of the tumour [7, 36]. In a recent study, a discrepancy between MMRD and MSI assessment was found [20]. Nevertheless, the overall concordance between immunohistochemical analysis of MMR protein expres- sion and MSI was high [20]. The authors explained the imperfect correlation with interobserver variability in immunohistochemical analysis assessment, heterogeneity of biomarker expression in gastric cancer, and the pres- ence of normally translated but non-functional MMR pro- teins in the setting of a missense MLH1 mutation, or rare genomic defects that result in MSI-H status with intact MMRD function, e.g., polymerase DNA ε1 mutation [20].
One of the advantages of IHC technique consists in its wide integration in routine testing in molecular and diagnostic pathology laboratories and in its ability in identifying which gene should be investigated for further molecular analyses in case of suspected hereditary cancer syndromes [30, 36]. Moreover, when IHC is used only the tumour tissue is required, whereas both normal and tumour samples are required for MSI testing with PCR [7]. Molecular testing with PCR detects MSI directly as a consequence of MMRD. In these 5–11% of MSI malignan- cies that do not exhibit MMR protein loss, usually due to retained antigenicity in an otherwise non-functional pro- tein, IHC may underestimate MSI-H cases. In this situa- tion, PCR-based test helps defining the correct diagnosis [20, 34, 36].

MSI evaluation by next‐generation sequencing (NGS)
Some laboratories started to use NGS to diagnose the micro- satellite status [37–39]. In most cases, also NGS-based MSI determination needs paired tumour and normal tissue [38, 39]. Recently, a MSI assay that uses data from a commercial available NGS panel for determination of the MSI status has been established [37]. One advantage of this NGS-based assay for MSI evaluation is that it does not require matched samples from normal tissue. Furthermore, NGS-based meth- ods cover a broader range of microsatellite loci; thus, it is not limited to the five microsatellite sites used in the PCR-based method [37]. The disadvantages are the high investment costs per sample for NGS and the longer time needed to perform NGS run and bioinformatic analysis in comparison to PCR and IHC-based MSI analysis methods.
Clinico‐pathological features of MSI gastric cancer
The highest incidence of GC is reported amongst Asiatic population [1], and thus, it is not unexpected that most of the information about histologic and clinical characteris- tics of microsatellite unstable GC is based on retrospective studies involving Asian GC patients [40–43]. Furthermore, MSI-H GC prevalence in Asians is commonly < 10% of all GC cases [44], lower than most of the rates reported in the Western studies concerning this topic [5, 45, 46]. Many data have been collected and analyzed to clarify whether MSI-H could be considered as a separate GC subgroup with specific histopathologic features, clinical behaviour, and different response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. TCGA first provided a comprehensive molecular characterization of GC based on 295 cases from a western population, and catego- rized them into four different subtypes (Table 1) [5]. The GC MSI-H subgroup is characterized by elevated mutation rate in genes encoding proteins involved in oncogenic signalling pathways, mutations at “hotspot” regions such as PIK3CA, ERBB3, ERBB2, and EGFR genes already described in other malignancies, e.g., colon and breast cancers, as well by methylation at the hMLH1 gene promoter [5, 47, 48]. Inter- estingly, in microsatellite unstable GC, BRAF V600E muta- tion, frequently reported in sporadic colon cancer caused by MSI, has never been described [47]. In general, MSI-H GC is associated to older age (> 65-year-old patients), female sex, onset in the distal stomach, intestinal type (according to Lauren classification) and more common in patients with multiple synchronous gastric cancers than in those with a solitary tumour [49]. The examination of multiple early GC treated with endoscopic mucosal resection revealed that MSI-H status increased the frequency of both synchronous and metachronous GC [50]. Among all these features, the association between onset at older age and MSI-H phenotype is observed in most of the studies focusing on this topic [40, 42, 44–46]. Methylation of hMLH1 gene and its progressive loss of expression have been related to aging [51]. Methyla- tion of this gene is the main cause for microsatellite unstable status in sporadic GC; this might explain the connection between onset of MSI-H GC and aging [29, 30]. Interest- ingly, in many studies, this subgroup showed a specific phenotype sharing similarities with medullary-type cancer or presenting lympho-plasmacytoid appearance [46]. More precisely, it was observed that MSI-H GC was enriched with highly pleomorphic tumour cells arranged in several growth patterns surrounded by an inflammatory stroma, with push- ing tumour borders and widespread expression of immune- checkpoint ligands [45, 46]. Many studies showed a positive correlation between the intestinal subtype and the microsat- ellite unstable phenotype, whereas poorly cohesive and dif- fuse histology are rarely associated with this GC subgroup. These findings are not always statistically robust, probably due to the small sample sizes involved in these studies [41, 44, 45]. Moreover, in some reports, an association between MSI-H and tumour phenotype was not found [45, 46]. In clinical setting, patients with MSI-H GC show a significant longer overall survival (OS) compared with those who have GC with MSS GC features. It has been argued that MSI-H GC has a better prognosis due to its correlation with earlier TNM stage at diagnosis (stages I–II), limited lymph-node metastasis, and Lauren intestinal histotype [45, 46]. Moreo- ver, immunological assessment of the microenvironment in MMRD tumours exhibits enhanced attraction of tumour- infiltrating lymphocytes and widespread expression of sev- eral immune checkpoint ligands like PD-L1, LAG-3, IDO, and CTLA4 [52, 53]. The higher mutational rate of MSI-H tumours compared with MSS group may explain these find- ings [21–23]. Tumours with high mutational burden have the potential to encode non-self immunogenic neoepitopes, which, in turn, activate recruitment of lymphocytes within the tumour, thus inducing an intense immune response [23, 52]. At the same time, the active immune microenvironment is counterbalanced by the expression of immune inhibitory signals that contrast tumour elimination, as illustrated in Fig. 1 [21, 22, 52, 54]. The hyper-activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes within the tumour may lead to increased apop- tosis of neoplastic cells, explaining the better outcomes of MSI-H GC patients compared to the MSS subgroup [20]. The Medical Research Council Adjuvant Gastric Infusional Chemotherapy (MAGIC) trial is the first prospective study reporting an association among MSI-H, MMRD, clinical features, and survival in patients with non-metastatic GC [20, 56]. This phase III study compared the effect of periop- erative chemotherapy with epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluo- rouracil plus surgery with surgery alone, in patients with resectable gastroesophageal cancer. Considering the clinico- pathological features of patients included in the trial, female sex, older median age, Lauren intestinal subtype, low rate of metastatic lymph nodes, and stomach location were found to be correlated to the MSI-H subgroup (8.5% of all patients), compared with MSS and MSI-L classes [20]. Although none of the reported differences between MSI-H and MSS-L cases resulted significant, data from MAGIC trial are widely over- lapping and confirm the main retrospective reports concern- ing microsatellite unstable GC [20, 42, 45, 46].

MSI survival and response to chemotherapy in the early and advanced stages of GC
The positive association between MSI-H phenotype, MMRD, and better prognosis has been suggested in several GC studies [41, 45, 46]. Two recent meta-analyses includ- ing 17 and 21 studies, respectively, found a consistent posi- tive effect of microsatellite unstable status on prognosis [42, 45]. Interestingly, the four different TCGA subgroups of GC [5] have been correlated to survival outcomes in another study [57]. In particular, the EBV subtype reported the best prognosis and the genomic stable (GS) subtype the worst. Microsatellite unstable subgroup and CIN are related with poor OS compared to EBV subtype but with more favourable survival rates compared with GS patients. These results were mainly attributable to the inflammatory microenvironment and immune response observed in subtypes with a better prognosis. More precisely, the immune response resulted strongly enhanced due to viral infection in EBV subtype and as a consequence of higher mutational rate in microsatel- lite unstable group. These events might prevent outgrowth of cancer cells and promote their apoptosis, resulting in improved OS [57]. In agreement with these results, a posi- tive effect of microsatellite stable vs unstable status on sur- vival, but restricted only to stage II disease, has been found in a retrospective trial involving 510 operated chemo-radio naïve GC, with 16% of MSI-H patients [58]. The recent post hoc analysis of the MAGIC trial first established a correla- tion between microsatellite status and survival in a rand- omized prospective study with a control group, confirming the positive prognostic value of MSI-H in GC chemo-radio naïve population [20]. Considering the group treated with surgery, OS was significantly better for patients with MSI-H than for those with MSS or MSI-L [20]. Moreover, MSI-H counteracts the negative impact of positive resection margin (R+) after gastrectomy on prognosis, as reported in a recent large retrospective study [59]. In this study, gastric cancer patients were stratified in MSI-H (26.4% of patients) and MSS (73.6% of patients) groups. Despite the presence of R+ margin status, long term-survival outcomes were reported in the MSI-H group only, with higher 3-, 5-, and 10-year disease-specific survival rates compared to MSS patients [59]. A large amount of studies attempted to define the prognostic value of MSI-H, but far less data regarding this molecular feature and response to chemotherapy are avail- able. Retrospective Asian studies supported the hypothesis that MSI-H stage II and III GC patients do not gain any benefit from adjuvant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy, whereas patients with MSS do [18, 19, 43]. This was verified also in the MAGIC trial where MSI-H patients treated with perioperative chemotherapy reported a twofold higher risk of death compared with those with MSS [20]. Recently, a pro- spective genomic-profiling research confirmed the MAGIC trial results and extended the predictive meaning of MSI also to the metastatic setting [60]. Metastatic oesophageal and GC samples were evaluated and 3% of patients were scored MSI-H. MSI-H tumours showed rapid disease progression on standard cytotoxic therapy with a significantly shorter progression-free survival compared with MSS patients [60]. The fast-progressing patients received the following line of treatment with anti-PD-1 antibodies (durvalumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab), as a single therapy or in combination with anti-CTLA4 antibodies (ipilimumab, tremelimumab). Nearly half of the patients with durable immunotherapy responses showed a higher mutational rate and an MSI-H status [60]. The detrimental effect of chemo- therapy compared with the remarkable results reported in immunotherapeutic trials may be explained on the basis of the peculiar behaviour and molecular features of MSI-H tumours reported above [5, 21–23, 52]. The MAGIC trial authors focused their attention on the unexpected differ- ent outcomes between MSI-H GC and colon cancer out- comes towards chemotherapy [20]. The choice of different platinum compound administered in the MAGIC trial— cisplatin for GC—and in colorectal cancer adjuvant stud- ies—oxaliplatin—may have influenced the results [20, 61]. In fact, in preclinical studies, hMLH1-deficient colon and endometrial cell lines have been reported to be resistant to cisplatin, but not to oxaliplatin [61]. Another interest- ing hypothesis suggested by MAGIC trial reports is based on the immune tumour microenvironment: MSI-H tumours are strongly associated with a vigorous immune infiltrate [20–23, 52], which may suppress the residual micrometas- tases after surgery [20]. Chemotherapy administration may have a negative effect on the immune defences, reducing the innate positive effect of the MSI-H phenotype on prog- nosis, whereas immune-checkpoint inhibitors may have a synergistic activity with immune response. Despite lacking of a strong validation [17–19, 42, 45], all these data suggest the future possibility of sparing unnecessary or even worse detrimental chemotherapy to MSI-H GC patients, basing the chemotherapeutic decision-making on molecular level for each patient selection [20]. The opportunity of alternative therapeutic strategies for this GC subtype, especially focused
on the immune response, might be a step towards a more personalized treatment and central issue for future studies.

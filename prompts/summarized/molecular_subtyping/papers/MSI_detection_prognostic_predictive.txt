MSI in Gastric Cancer
The TCGA has included MSI status in the molecular classification of GC. Particularly, the TCGA classified GC in different molecular subsets, including the chromosome insta- bility phenotypes (CIN), accounting for 50% of cases, the genomically stable (GS) tumors, accounting for 19%, the MSI phenotype, accounting for 22%, and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive tumors, accounting for 9% (Figure 1) [88]. Although rare cases simultane- ously carrying MSI and EBV have been identified, the TCGA considers MSI as a molecular profile distinct from the others [89]. Similarly, the Asian Cancer Research Group (ACRG) classified GC in MSS and MSI [90]. Many studies have found MSI in precancerous lesions and an increase in MSI frequency in GC cases is observed [91,92]. MSI GCs usually occur in older female patients, with an intestinal subtype at an early stage (I/II) and with better differentiation and distal position, and no lymph node involvement [44,91]. Ottini et al. observed that the MLH1 promoter methylation is frequently in sporadic GC, while MLH1 and MSH2 mutations are rare in MSI GCs [93]. MSI occurs both in sporadic GCs and in GCs associated with LS [94,95]. A positive correlation was observed between the presence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and MSI. The active bacterial infection is present more frequently in GC MSI patients, suggesting that H. pylori may affect the MMR system during the gradual progression of gastric carcinogenesis [52]. Approximately 85% of the MSI GC cases concomitantly showed a KRAS mutation. On the contrary, no association between MSI GC and a mutated BRAF was reported [96]. MSI and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification are reported to be mutually exclusive, suggesting that HER2 amplification could be a negative predictive marker for immunotherapy in GC patients [97]. The MSI status is not used as an exclusive prognostic biomarker, since the prognosis of GC patients is affected by other clinical and pathological features, including the age, stage, grade and chemotherapy treatment [98]. To date, controversial data about the prognostic role of MSI in GC have been reported. Several studies have shown that GCs carrying MSI have a good prognosis [91,99,100]. However, other studies showed MSI not having a prognostic role; in particular, MSI GCs do not have a better survival time than MSI-L/MSS patients. [101,102]. The metastatic MSI GCs have shown long-lasting positive results after receiving treatment with anti-PD-1 antibodies (durvalumab, pembrolizumab and nivolumab), as a single therapy or in combination with anti-CTLA4 antibodies (ipili- mumab and tremelimumab) [103]. Pembrolizumab was investigated among patients with advanced MSI gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer who were enrolled in different studies, such as KEYNOTE-059, KEYNOTE-061 and KEYNOTE-062. The results indicate that pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy provided durable antitumor activity compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with an MSI gastric junction or gas- troesophageal cancer. Other clinical trials have suggested drug combinations, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab or nivolumab and ipilimumab in phase 2, for the treatment of advanced MSI GC [104–106] (Table 3). The comparative analysis between these methods showed some discrepancies, particularly as some dMMR-IHC cases were MSS by PCR (ranging from 1% to 38%) [51,107], while pMMR-IHC cases were MSI by molecular analysis (ranging from 1% to 7,4%) [52,108,109].
The FDA accelerated approval of pembrolizumab in 2017 to treat MSI patients in solid tumors, including GC, who have progressed following prior treatment [27]. Few data have been reported regarding the MSI testing in GC; all the comparison data between IHC and PCR are summarized in Table 4.

Conclusions
The MMR system is a key repair mechanism for maintaining sequence fidelity and stability. The inactivation of the MMR system due to the germinal, somatic or epigenetic prevents error correction and, thus, promotes microsatellite instability. MSI has been detected in various cancers with a prognostic and/or predictive role; in particular, it is clinically important for predicting a response to immunotherapy. MSI represents the FDA’s first cancer type-agnostic biomarker approved for selection to the treatment with pembrolizumab of patients with any advanced solid cancer, regardless of the histology. The results reported underline the pivotal role of MSI in the choice of drug treatment in patients, especially in the cases of those who no longer respond to chemotherapy. To date, MSI detection aimed at selecting patients for ICI treatment could be performed through both IHC and PCR/NGS. Although the two tests are equated in clinical practice for the therapeutic choice, several controversial results have been reported. In this view, the optimization of MSI detection in clinical practice is currently needed in order to implement an adequate selection of patients eligible for ICI treatment of dMMR tumors. A feasible diagnostic algorithm for MSI testing could include IHC as prescreening requiring an additional molecular test for cases with an equivocal IHC of one or more MMR proteins, and also to confirm dMMR cases in order to exclude false IHC results.

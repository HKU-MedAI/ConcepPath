Abstract
Epstein–Barr virus-positive gastric cancer [EBV (+) GC] is associated with EBV infection and is one of the GC subtypes defined by the Cancer Genome Atlas. EBV (+) GC has several distinct genomic or epigenomic features and clinicopatho- logical characteristics compared with other molecular subtypes of GC. Here, we summarize the unique features of EBV (+) GC including the clinical and histopathological features, and discuss associated genetic and epigenetic aberrations. We also discuss noncoding RNAs [EBV-encoded RNAs and EBV-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs)] derived from EBV-infected cells, which have not been described in detail previously. These noncoding RNAs are defined by their roles; for example, EBV-encoded miRNAs play pivotal roles in oncogenesis and tumor progression in EBV (+) GC. We also discuss recent advances in therapeutic modalities for EBV (+) GC, as well as the potential of EBV infection as a predictive biomarker of the response to anti-PD-1 therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We introduce our recent studies focusing on AT-rich interactive domain 1A gene mutations and programmed death ligand-1 overexpression/CD274 copy-number amplification, which are recurrently identified in EBV (+) GC. Finally, based on those findings, we propose potential therapeutic options using candidate-targeted therapies against EBV (+) GC.
Introduction
A recent large-scale genome sequencing study conducted by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed significant heterogeneity in gastric cancer (GC), resulting in the clas- sification of GC into four molecular subtypes: microsatel- lite instability (MSI), genomically stable (GS), chromo- somal instability (CIN), and Epstein–Barr virus-positive gastric cancer [EBV (+) GC] [1]. Among them, EBV (+) GC is defined by infection with EBV, which is a human herpes virus 4, and by several unique molecular features [2]. EBV acts as an oncogenic virus in GC as well as in Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and nasopharyn- geal carcinoma, and its presence is clinically demonstrated using EBV-encoded small RNA 1 (EBER-1) in situ hybridi- zation (ISH) [2, 3]. Although EBV is associated with GC, the mechanisms of gastric carcinogenesis induced by EBV infection are not yet fully understood. EBV (+) GC is asso- ciated with the monoclonal proliferation of EBV-infected cells and shows several distinct genomic or epigenomic characteristics compared with other molecular subtypes of GC, suggesting that EBV infection contributes to the malig- nant transformation of normal cells in GC [1, 4–6]. Here, we summarize various features of EBV (+) GC and discuss the clinical and histopathological features of EBV (+) GC (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we describe in more detail the genetic and epigenetic modifications and unique characteristics of EBV (+) GC [1, 4, 6, 7]. We introduce several recent find- ings of genomic or epigenomic modifications in EBV (+) GC, focusing on AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) gene mutations and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) overexpression/CD274 copy-number amplification [8–13].
Clinical and histopathological features of EBV (+) GC
EBV (+) GC accounts for 2–20% of total GC cases, with a worldwide average of < 10% of total GC cases [1, 2, 11]. Geographical and environmental factors may affect the incidence rate, as EBV (+) GC is slightly more prevalent in Caucasians than in Asians [2]. EBV (+) GC predominantly occurs in men and at a relatively young age, and it local- izes to the upper part of the stomach [2]. Consistent with previous studies, our analysis of a Japanese cohort, which included 401 GC tumors, identified 27 (6.7%) EBV (+) cases, which predominantly occurred in men, with a rela- tively early onset, and were located in the upper part of the stomach [11]. Typical macroscopic features of EBV (+) GC on endoscopic observation include superficial, depressed, ulcerated, or saucer-like tumors, as well as marked thick- ening of the gastric wall [5]. Typical microscopic features of EBV (+) GC include moderately-to-poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with lymphocyte infiltration and a lace pattern within the mucosa [2, 5]. However, certain EBV (+) GCs manifest as conventional-type adenocarcinomas, namely, well-to-moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma without lymphocyte infiltration and a lace pattern. These cases are difficult to diagnose as EBV (+) GC without per- forming EBER-ISH.
Latent EBV infection
When EBV infects normal gastric epithelial cells, EBV- infected cells grow clonally, resulting in the development of EBV (+) GC. During the development of EBV-associated cancers, EBV infection is maintained in a latent form, and three types of latency states have been identified [2, 14]. EBV (+) GC belongs to latency I and II, in which EBERs (EBER-1 and EBER-2), EBV-determined nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1), BamHI-A rightward transcripts (BARTs), and BART microRNAs (miRNAs) are expressed and signifi- cantly associated with gastric tumorigenesis.
EBERs are the most abundantly expressed small noncod- ing RNAs in latent EBV-infected cells, and their involvement in malignant processes was reported previously [15, 16]. EBERs stimulate Tool-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and RIG-I in the TLR and RIG-I signaling pathways, respectively, includ- ing TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) [14]. TBK1 is a serine/ threonine protein kinase that plays essential roles in innate immunity, regulating inflammatory responses, and oncogen- esis through the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7 transcription factors. IRF is a family of transcriptional factors activating IFNs and regulating a dif- ferentiation and maturation of T cells, B cells, and plasma cells [17]. While IRF3 mediates immune response against viral infections, IRF3 is a key downstream transcriptional effector involved in inflammation and immunity in EBV- infected tumors. It is known that, in addition to TLR and RIG-I signaling pathways, TBK1 and IRF3 are involved in the cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS)-STING signaling pathway, which is associated with the innate immune system. We recently identified a novel mechanism by which phosphorylated IRF3 induces PD-L1 overexpres- sion in EBV (+) GC (discussed later) [11]. EBER-1, a highly expressed latency gene in EBV-infected tumors, can be used for the diagnosis of EBV infection by EBER-1-ISH.
Genetic aberrations in EBV (+) GC
Common genetic features of EBV (+) GC include fre- quent mutations in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) and ARID1A and copy-number amplifications of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and CD274/PDCD1LG2.
Somatic mutations
ARID1A, a subunit of the Switch/Sucrose Non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex, is frequently mutated in GC [1, 9, 18]. ARID1A is a tumor suppressor gene and driver oncogene in GC, and most of the identi- fied ARID1A mutations are truncating mutations that result in loss of ARID1A protein expression [1]. We and others reported that ARID1A protein expression is a useful prog- nostic indicator in GC or undifferentiated GC, and negative expression of ARID1A is associated with worse overall sur- vival [8, 12, 19, 20]. According to a TCGA study, ARID1A is recurrently mutated in EBV (+) and MSI GC [1]. Analysis of the relation between ARID1A gene mutations and protein expression shows that most of the cases with ARID1A pro- tein loss harbor ARID1A truncating mutations in MSI GC [18]. By contrast, cases with ARID1A protein loss despite the absence of ARID1A truncating mutations are detected in EBV (+) GC. These findings suggest that epigenetic modifi- cations contribute to the loss of ARID1A protein expression in EBV (+) GC (discussed later). PIK3CA, a p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K, is an onco- gene in various cancers including GC [21, 22]. According to TCGA data, nonsynonymous mutations of PIK3CA are detected in 12% of total GC and are preferentially detected in 80% of EBV (+) GC [1]. PIK3CA mutations in EBV (+) GC are mainly localized in the kinase domain (exon 20), suggesting that the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors should be higher in patients with EBV (+) GC.
Another genetic feature of EBV (+) GC is lack of TP53 mutations. The TP53 tumor suppressor is the most recur- rently mutated gene in GC; however, TP53 mutations are not frequent in EBV (+) GC among the GC subtypes classified by TCGA [1, 23, 24].
Somatic copy‐number alterations
Somatic copy-number alterations are observed in various cancers and have critical roles via activating oncogenes and in inactivating tumor suppressors [25, 26]. Unique copy-number alterations with commonly amplified loci, such as 9p24.1, 17q12, and 11p13, or deleted loci, such as 16q23.1, 7q31.1, 9p24.1, 4q22.1, 10q23.31, and 20p12.1, are detected in EBV (+) GC [1, 27]. The most remarkable copy-number aberration in EBV (+) GC is focal chromo- some 9p24.1 amplification, which includes JAK2, CD274, and PDCD1LG2, leading to constitutive expression of JAK2, PD-L1, and PD-L2, respectively [1]. Among these, we focused on elucidating the mechanism underlying PD-L1/ CD274 overexpression in EBV (+) GC. The results showed that higher PD-L1 overexpression in EBV (+) GC tumor cells is due to high levels of CD274 focal amplification, whereas CD274 copy-number alteration is not observed in EBV (+) or EBV (−) GC tumor cells with lower PD-L1 overexpression [11]. These findings are in line with our previous report that focal and high-level amplification of CD274 results in higher PD-L1 overexpression in a small subset of small cell lung cancers, which is related to the mechanism inducing PD-L1 overexpression in EBV (+) GC. Detailed analysis of infiltrating immune cells in EBV (+) GC showed that, in contrast to EBV (+) GC tumors with higher PD-L1 overexpression due to focal CD274 amplification, those with lower PD-L1 overexpression are associated with the presence of CD8 T cells [11]. In addition, we elucidated a unique mechanism of PD-L1 overexpression in EBV (+) GC by which EBV infection activates IRF3, driving PD-L1 overexpression via interferon-γ (IFN-γ) [11, 28, 29]. TCGA data confirmed that EBV (+) GC tumors with focal CD274 amplification show higher PD-L1 overexpression, whereas those without CD274 copy-number aberrations show lower PD-L1 overexpression without infiltration of CD8 + lympho- cytes [11]. These results indicate that copy-number altera- tions related to PD-L1 overexpression are associated with complex inflammatory signals in the tumor microenviron- ment of EBV (+) GC, suggesting the activation of unique innate antiviral immune responses to EBV infection.
Epigenetic aberrations in EBV (+) GC
Common epigenetic features of EBV (+) GC include exten- sive DNA promoter hypermethylation and altered expression of EBV-encoded miRNAs.
Methylation
DNA methylation has also known to have critical roles in tumorigenesis in the control of certain tissue-specific gene activity [30, 31]. Aberrant CpG hypermethylation in pro- moter and non-promoter CpG islands is a unique epige- netic aberration in EBV (+) GC. DNA hypermethylation of CDKN2A, but not the MLH1 promoter, is a distinct epi- genetic feature of EBV (+) GC [1]. Many genes involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis show hypermethylation in the CpG DNA promoter, which sup- presses their expression in EBV (+) GC [2, 7]. A TCGA study identified several methylation-related silencing genes (RCOR2, RHOF, TMEM52, CLDN3, and HOXA10) in EBV (+) GC [27]. Recent work from our group identified mark- edly hypermethylated genes (ACE, SLC7A9, and TUBA8) in EBV (+) GC using the microarray dataset GSE31789, including CpG site methylation data for EBV (+) GC and EBV (−) GC [7, 10]. Consistently, EBV infection of MKN7 GC cells induces hypermethylation of EBV (+) marker genes and suppresses their expression, confirming that EBV infection-induced epigenetic modifications play a pivotal role in the oncogenesis and tumor progression of EBV (+) GC [7].
EBV‐encoded miRNAs
EBV is the first virus shown to encode its own miRNAs. MiRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules of approxi- mately 21–25 nucleotides in length that interact with the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs. MiRNAs thus regulate target gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through translational repression or by inducing the deg- radation of the target mRNA [32–34]. EBV-encoded miR- NAs are divided into two major clusters, BamHI fragment H rightward open reading flame 1 (BHRF1) and BART miR- NAs [2, 35]. Several predicted targets of EBV-encoded miR- NAs were detected by computational prediction, and some of these were functionally investigated using an in vitro assay [36]. BHRF1 miRNAs, which encode three pri-miRNAs, show almost undetectable expression in EBV (+) GC; thus, their functional roles in lytic infection, in regulating host cell cycle and viral infection, and in progeny production, were revealed in various types of malignancy rather than in GC [37–45]. In GC specifically, BART miRNAs encoding 44 mature miRNAs may disrupt genes involved in apopto- sis and cell cycle regulation, as confirmed in EBV (+) GC (Table 1) [2, 10, 36, 45–59]. It is currently accepted that EBV-encoded miRNAs play important regulatory roles in EBV-mediated gastric carcinogenesis.
We recently investigated EBV-encoded miRNAs that can regulate ARID1A expression in EBV (+) GC based on the identification of cases with ARID1A protein loss despite the lack of ARID1A truncating mutations in EBV (+) GC [18]. We first investigated epigenetic modifications such as DNA promoter hypermethylation; however, we found that ARID1A is not hypermethylated in EBV (+) GC tumors and EBV- infected GC cells [4, 10]. We therefore conducted in silico analysis to identify EBV-encoded miRNAs that may target ARID1A, and confirmed that miR-BART11-3p and miR- BART12 directly target ARID1A, downregulating ARID1A protein levels in EBV (+) GC harboring ARID1A-WT [10].
Therapeutic responses of EBV (+) GC patients in precision medicine
In this review, we summarized the clinical and histopatho- logical features of EBV (+) GC and the genetic and epige- netic aberrations that underlie EBV-associated gastric car- cinogenesis. Studies that contribute to our understanding of the molecular characteristics of these aberrations may improve the therapeutic efficacy of precision medicine for EBV (+) GC (Fig. 2). Because immune checkpoint inhibi- tors targeting the PD-1 axis are used for the treatment of GC, it was reported that EBV (+) tumors as well as MSI-high or a high PD-L1 combined positive score are used as predictive biomarkers of the response to anti-PD-1 mAbs in metastatic GC patients [60]. In fact, several clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors in EBV (+) GC are currently underway [6]. However, tumors with PD-L1 overexpression associ- ated with high levels of CD274 focal amplification without lymphocyte infiltration may not show a favorable response to anti-PD-1 mAbs [11]. In addition, because ARID1A is one of the most frequently mutated genes in EBV (+) GC, targeted therapies against ARID1A mutations could provide impor- tant therapeutic benefits to patients. However, because the ARID1A tumor suppressor gene is frequently inactivated, ARID1A is a poor therapeutic target by itself. Furthermore, potential candidate targets or pathways underlying ARID1A deficiency have not been identified, suggesting that specific inhibitors targeting genes downstream of ARID1A defi- ciency may not provide a therapeutic benefit [8]. Synthetic lethal approaches to the treatment of ARID1A-deficient tumors were recently proposed using specific inhibitors against enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). These strate- gies demonstrate the selective sensitivity of EZH2 inhibi- tors against ARID1A-deficient GC cells, and suggest the potential efficacy of targeted therapy using a synthetic lethal approach for ARID1A-deficient EBV (+) GC [9]. Because treatment strategies based on synthetic lethality are a valid approach to the treatment of various cancers, inhibitors of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) or AKT are expected to show efficacy in EBV (+) GC harboring ARID1A muta- tions [61, 62]. These breakthrough treatments against ARID1A-mutated/-deficient or PD-L1 overexpressing tumors may yield positive results in EBV (+) GC.
Conclusion
The molecular features of EBV (+) GC have been eluci- dated in detail including genetic and epigenetic regula- tion. Because of the distinct molecular regulatory pattern of EBV (+) GC, several possible therapies ranging from immune checkpoint inhibitors to synthetic lethal approaches to the ARID1A axis can be selected as precision medicine strategies.

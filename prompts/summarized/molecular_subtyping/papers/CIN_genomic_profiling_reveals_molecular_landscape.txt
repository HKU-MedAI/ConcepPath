Gastrointestinal tract cancers have high incidence and mortality in China, but their molecular characteristics have not been fully investigated. We sequenced 432 tumor samples from the colorectum, stomach, pancreas, gallbladder, and biliary tract to investigate cancer-related mutations and detail the landscape of microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutation burden (TMB), and chromosomal instability (CIN). We observed the highest TMB in colorectal and gastric cancers and the lowest TMB in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Twenty-four hyper-mutated tumors were identified only in colorectal and gastric cancers, with a significant enrichment of mutations in the polymerase genes (POLE, POLD1, and POLH) and mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Additionally, CIN preferentially occurred in colorectal and gastric cancers, while pancreatic, gallbladder, and biliary duct cancers had a much lower CIN. High CIN was correlated with a higher prevalence of malfunctions in chromosome segregation and cell cycle genes, including the copy number loss of WRN, NAT1, NF2, and BUB1B, and the copy number gain of MYC, ERBB2, EGFR, and CDK6. In addition, TP53 mutations were more abundant in high-CIN tumors, while PIK3CA mutations were more frequent in low-CIN tumors. In colorectal and gastric cancers, tumors with MSI demonstrated much fewer copy number changes than microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. In colorectal and gastric cancers, the molecular characteristics of tumors revealed the mutational diversity between the different anatomical origins of tumors. This study provides novel insights into the molecular landscape of Chinese gastrointestinal cancers and the genetic differences between tumor locations, which could be useful for future clinical patient stratification and targeted interventions.

INTRODUCTION
Gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancer refers to a group of cancers affecting the GI and accessory digestive organs, such as the pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and biliary ducts. GI cancers account for almost 30% of all cancer incidences, and 38% of global cancer-related mortality (Bray et al., 2018). GI cancers are difficult to diagnose at early stages due to the lack of symptoms, resulting in limited treatment options for such patients. In the past few years, extensive efforts have been made toward the molecular characterization of GI cancers for the development of novel diagnostic and treatment strategies (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; Cristescu et al., 2015; Guinney et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2018).
Driver mutations in TP53, APC, KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA are recurrent in GI cancers, but the mutation frequencies vary between different tumor types (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014, 2017; Wardell et al., 2018). Genome-level evaluations revealed distinct genomic statuses in GI cancers, including in terms of genomic stability (GS), chromosomal instability (CIN), and microsatellite instability (MSI) that potentially facilitate clinical treatment options (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2014; Liu et al., 2018). CIN is defined as whole-chromosome mis-segregation that results in the loss or gain of large chromosomal fragments, and is positively correlated to tumor metastasis, poor prognosis, and treatment resistance (Lee et al., 2011; Pikor et al., 2013; Bakhoum and Cantley, 2018). Conversely, MSI, which is characterized as high numbers of mutations in microsatellite repeats, is associated with increased intra- tumor immune infiltration and better prognoses (Pages et al., 2005, 2008). Thus, newly identified tumor biomarkers are significantly changing the tumor staging systems and treatment landscapes for GI cancers.
In China, stomach and colorectal cancers are the leading causes of death, immediately after lung and liver cancers (Chen et al., 2016). However, pancreatic, gallbladder, and biliary duct cancers are relatively rare, but their prognoses are much worse, and the availability of non-surgical treatments is limited. Compared to Western countries, the high smoking rate, the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infections, heavy alcohol consumption, and poor nutrition are the factors contributing to the high incidences of digestive system cancers in China (Gu et al., 2018). Here, we report the molecular profiles of 423 GI tumors using targeted gene sequencing, including those of gastric cancer (GAST), colorectal cancer (CORE), pancreatic cancer (PAAD), gallbladder and biliary tract cancer (GABI), and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Recurrent somatic mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) were identified and compared across different tumors or sub-locations of the same tumors. The tumor genomes were also detailed for MSI, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and chromosome instability (CIN) that are closely related to treatment selection and prognostic predictions.

Tumor TMB and CIN Indicate New Treatment Strategies
The TMB of all patients ranged between 1 and 185 (median: 5), with the highest median in CORE (median: 6) and the lowest median in GIST (median: 2.5, Figure 1D). However, both CORE (9%) and GAST (3%) had a small high-TMB population, named hyper-mutated tumors in this study (n = 26, Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 2). Of these 24 hyper-mutated tumors, 23 (92%) had at least one somatic or germline mutation in the MMR genes, including MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS1, and PMS2, or the polymerase (POL) genes, including POLE, POLD1, and POLH. In low-mutation tumors, only 30% of tumors (117 out of 388 tumors) had mutations in the MMR and POL genes (Figure 2A). Somatic mutations in MSH2, MSH6, MLH3, PMS1, PMS2, POLE, and POLD1 were significantly higher in hyper-mutated tumors than low-mutation tumors (FDR < 0.01). POLE and POLD1
mutations (including somatic and germline) in hyper-mutated tumors were dispersed across all domains of the two POLs (Figure 2B), with only POLE p.P286R and POLD1 p.R689W being reported to have functional disruption (Ahn et al., 2016; Mertz et al., 2017). However, we observed that a POLE p.A1778V mutation in patient #GA_59, who developed gastric cancer at age 76 with a TMB of 45 (71% were missense mutations), was the only mutation in the polymerases and MMR genes in this patient, suggesting that this mutation might impair POLE function. We also identified a novel mutation in POLD1 from three hyper- mutated patients (#CO_129, CO_26, and CO_273), a somatic splicing variant c.2954-1delG that disrupts the zinc finger domain of POLD1 and can be potentially harmful. Notably, in low- mutation tumors, somatic and germline mutations in the MMR and POL genes were almost exclusive from each other, while in the hyper-mutated group, the total number of mutations in the MMR and POL genes were significantly higher (p < 0.01, Figure 2C).
Another genome marker that we inspected was CIN. CIN is a critical hallmark of cancer and is closely related to tumor metastasis, treatment resistance, and poor prognosis (Pikor et al., 2013; Bakhoum and Cantley, 2018). The CIN score was used to measure the extent of copy number changes in large segments in an individual tumor. The CIN score ranged widely in each cancer (Figure 3A). The median CIN was relatively higher in GIST (0.40), CORE (0.31), and GAST (0.27) tumors, and lower in GABI (0.18) and PAAD (0.11) tumors (Figure 3A). The mechanisms causing CIN have not been fully elucidated. It
was suggested that chromosome segregation genes and cell cycle genes were widely related to CIN (Maleki and Rocken, 2017).
We compared the mutation frequencies between high-CIN and low-CIN tumors to identify the associated gene alterations (Figure 3B). TP53 was significantly enriched in high-CIN tumors (FDR < 0.01), which was consistent with previous reports of mitotic stress caused by TP53 malfunctions (Malumbres, 2011).
In addition, we also observed broad copy number loss of WRN, NAT1, NF2, and BUB1B, as well as copy number gain of MYC, ERBB2, EGFR, and CDK6 in high-CIN tumors (FDR < 0.01, Figure 3B). The copy number loss of WRN and NAT1 were almost concurrent, possibly because of their adjacent genomic locations. PIK3CA is the only signature that was significantly enriched in low-CIN tumors (FDR < 0.1, Figure 3B).

DISCUSSION
Herein, we performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of different GI cancers. This is the first large-scale study of GI cancers in Chinese patients that implemented a uniform genetic testing and data analysis pipeline. The results highlighted the similarities and differences in the genetic landscapes of GI cancers and also informed on the status of several biomarkers for cancer treatment, including MSI status, TMB, and CIN between different cancer types. The high mutation frequency of TP53, APC, and KRAS in CORE and that of KRAS in PAAD were reported in multiple other studies (Vogelstein et al., 1988; Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1996; Bardeesy and DePinho, 2002). However, the frequency of TP53 alterations was higher in our CORE cohort than in other reported populations (Olivier et al., 2002; Abubaker et al., 2008). Such a finding might be due to the presence of more advanced disease stages at the time of diagnosis in this study. Mutations in the KIT gene were recognized as a relatively early event in GIST tumorigenesis, while TP53 mutations were related to the malignant transformation of GIST (Ryu et al., 2004).
Although we lacked pathological stage information of the GIST patients in our cohort, the high KIT mutation frequency and low TP53 mutation frequency that we observed suggested that GIST patients were at an early disease stage. This assumption was also supported by the fact that we did not observe high frequencies of RB1 mutations in the GIST population, which was an event that might be restricted to malignant GISTs (Merten et al., 2016).
Significantly aberrant Wnt signaling was observed in CORE compared to other cancer types, and this pathway has been closely linked to carcinogenesis (Mirabelli et al., 2019). Many inhibitors targeting the Wnt signaling pathway are being examined in different clinical trials, including porcupine (PORCN) inhibitors, WNT ligand antagonists, and FZD antagonists/monoclonal antibodies (Jung and Park, 2020). In Chinese CORE and GAAD patients, both APC and RNF43 were predominantly mutated in the Wnt pathway. A significant subset of patients had nonsense or frameshift alterations in RNF43, particularly high frequencies in the MSI-H group. Such mutations were also mutually exclusive with APC alterations. As a tumor suppressor, RNF43 has shown its capacity to negatively regulate Wnt signaling (Koo et al., 2012; Loregger et al., 2015). Recent studies found that depletion of RNF43 enhanced tumor growth in GI cancers and conferred resistance to DNA-damage- inducing chemotherapies and γ-radiation in gastric cancer cells (Neumeyer et al., 2019, 2020). Additionally, preclinical cancer models have shown the responsiveness of RNF43 mutations to Wnt inhibitors, several of which are in clinical trials (Janku et al., 2015, 2020; Yu et al., 2020). Therefore, screening for RNF43 mutational status could direct therapy selections for GI cancer treatments.
Among all cancer types, CORE and GAST demonstrated significantly higher TMB than others, while GIST demonstrated relatively higher CIN scores. In both CORE and GAST, a small group of patients were characterized by MSI-H, and their CIN levels were correspondingly lower than those of the MSS groups, thus suggesting that tumors obtain a survival advantage through either high mutational loads or high levels of somatic copy number alterations (SCNA). Both TMB and MSI are emerging biomarkers for immune checkpoint inhibitors and CIN has the potential to drive tumor evolution and treatment resistance (Jin et al., 2020). CIN, which was characterized by increasing the mis-segregation of chromosomes, can be induced by defects in the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoints, cell cycle regulation, multipolar spindles, or DNA damage responses (Thompson et al., 2010; Bakhoum et al., 2012). The acquisition of CIN is an essential feature in cancer pathogenesis and is considered as compensation for a lack of driver mutations (Turajlic et al., 2018). CIN is also considered a drug-resistant mechanism during cancer treatment and negatively correlates with the progression- free survival and overall survival of cancer patients (Turajlic et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2020). In our cohort, we observed a high level of TP53 mutations in high-CIN patients, while PIK3CA alterations were significantly enriched in low-CIN patients, with a tendency for mutual exclusivity with TP53 mutations. These findings are consistent with previous reports that TP53 inactivation results in CIN tolerance in cells (Thompson and Compton, 2010; Matano et al., 2015).
Although PIK3CA acts independently of TP53 inactivation to support CIN tolerance, it generally precedes the genome doubling event (Carter et al., 2012; Zack et al., 2013; Berenjeno et al., 2017). The GIST population has the highest median level of CIN, despite its low mutation frequency in TP53 and the cell cycle pathway compared to that observed in other cancer types. A further look at the high-CIN and median-CIN groups of GIST identified a much higher level of NF2 copy number deletion in the high-CIN group than the low-CIN group. NF2 inactivation has been linked to increased CIN in meningiomas (Goutagny et al., 2010; Dewan et al., 2017), but for the first time, we report that its copy number deletion is potentially associated with high CIN level in GIST. However, this finding must be validated in a much larger cohort of GIST samples.
Although CIN potentially drives tumor evolution and drug resistance via the production of oncogenic SCNA, excessive levels of CIN were proven to be detrimental to tumor growth (Roylance et al., 2011; Janssen and Medema, 2013), thus creating the opportunity for developing therapies aimed at increasing the CIN level of tumors. Currently, a few agents targeting Mps1/TTK kinase to induce CIN have been evaluated in phase I clinical trials, including BAY1217389 (NCT02366949), BAY1161909 (NCT02138812), and BOS172722 (NCT03328494; clinicaltrials.gov). However, the success of this strategy relies on patient stratification based on their CIN levels, and the co- existence of gene alterations (e.g., TP53 or PIK3CA) that can reduce the toxicity of elevated CIN.
Malfunctioning DNA repair mechanisms caused by somatic mutations in MMR genes is common in cancer and contributes to MMR deficiency, and high TMB and MSI phenotypes (Bodor et al., 2018). Indeed, the majority of the hyper-mutated tumors in our cohort were observed to have somatic mutations in MMR genes. MSI-H tumors were also found to have a higher ratio of MMR gene mutations compared to MSS tumors. Recent studies have suggested that mutations in DNA polymerase (POL) genes are other factors that are associated with a hyper-mutated tumor phenotype, especially in colon and rectal cancers (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012). Interestingly, in hyper-mutated tumors, we observed concomitant somatic or germline mutations in the MMR and POL genes, with a median of three MMR/POL mutations per tumor, which was significantly higher than that of low-mutation tumors (a median of one MMR/POL mutation per tumor). However, currently only a few non-synonymous mutations in the exonuclease domains (EDM) of POLE (residues 268–471) and POLD1 (residues 304–517) have been considered pathogenic (Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013), while most others are classified as variants of unknown significance. Increasing evidence suggests that patients with POLE EDMs are prone to higher TMBs and an upregulation of immune checkpoint genes, which could potentially benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (Snyder et al., 2014; Rayner et al., 2016; Mo et al., 2020).
The limitations of this study included the lack of clinical treatment and prognostic information, which is typical in any retrospective study. Therefore we are unable to determine the treatment outcomes that were potentially linked to the genomic findings of different cancer types. However, our analysis of a large cohort of advanced GIs revealed the landscape of genetic alterations, highlighted the genomic differences between tumor locations, such as between right- and left-sided CRC, and identified the unique molecular features in Asian GI cancer patients.
